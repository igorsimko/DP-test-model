In set theory, the union (denoted by ∪) of a collection of sets is the set of all elements in the collection.[1] It is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other.

Union of two sets[edit]
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. In symbols,


  
    
      
        A
        ∪
        B
        =
        {
        x
        :
        x
        ∈
        A
        
           or 
        
        x
        ∈
        B
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cup B=\{x:x\in A{\text{  or  }}x\in B\}}
  
.[2]

For example, if A = {1, 3, 5, 7} and B = {1, 2, 4, 6} then A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. A more elaborate example (involving two infinite sets) is:

A = {x is an even integer larger than 1}
B = {x is an odd integer larger than 1}

  
    
      
        A
        ∪
        B
        =
        {
        2
        ,
        3
        ,
        4
        ,
        5
        ,
        6
        ,
        …
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cup B=\{2,3,4,5,6,\dots \}}
  


As another example, the number 9 is not contained in the union of the set of prime numbers {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …} and the set of even numbers {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}, because 9 is neither prime nor even.
Sets cannot have duplicate elements,[2][3] so the union of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {1, 2, 3, 4}. Multiple occurrences of identical elements have no effect on the cardinality of a set or its contents.
Algebraic properties[edit]
Binary union is an associative operation; that is, for any sets A, B, and C,


  
    
      
        A
        ∪
        (
        B
        ∪
        C
        )
        =
        (
        A
        ∪
        B
        )
        ∪
        C
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C.}
  


The operations can be performed in any order, and the parentheses may be omitted without ambiguity (i.e., either of the above can be expressed equivalently as A ∪ B ∪ C). Similarly, union is commutative, so the sets can be written in any order.[4]
The empty set is an identity element for the operation of union. That is, A ∪ ∅ = A, for any set A. This follows from analogous facts about logical disjunction.
Since sets with unions and intersections form a Boolean algebra, intersection distributes over union


  
    
      
        A
        ∩
        (
        B
        ∪
        C
        )
        =
        (
        A
        ∩
        B
        )
        ∪
        (
        A
        ∩
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)}
  


and union distributes over intersection


  
    
      
        A
        ∪
        (
        B
        ∩
        C
        )
        =
        (
        A
        ∪
        B
        )
        ∩
        (
        A
        ∪
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)}
  
 .

Within a given universal set, union can be written in terms of the operations of intersection and complement as


  
    
      
        A
        ∪
        B
        =
        
          
            (
            
              
                A
                
                  C
                
              
              ∩
              
                B
                
                  C
                
              
            
            )
          
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cup B=\left(A^{C}\cap B^{C}\right)^{C}}
  


where the superscript C denotes the complement with respect to the universal set.
Finite unions[edit]
One can take the union of several sets simultaneously. For example, the union of three sets A, B, and C contains all elements of A, all elements of B, and all elements of C, and nothing else. Thus, x is an element of A ∪ B ∪ C if and only if x is in at least one of A, B, and C.
In mathematics a finite union means any union carried out on a finite number of sets; it does not imply that the union set is a finite set.[5][6]
Arbitrary unions[edit]
The most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union. If M is a set or class whose elements are sets, then x is an element of the union of M if and only if there is at least one element A of M such that x is an element of A.[7] In symbols:


  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        ⋃
        
          M
        
        
        ⟺
        
        ∃
        A
        ∈
        
          M
        
        ,
         
        x
        ∈
        A
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in \bigcup \mathbf {M} \iff \exists A\in \mathbf {M} ,\ x\in A.}
  


This idea subsumes the preceding sections—for example, A ∪ B ∪ C is the union of the collection {A, B, C}. Also, if M is the empty collection, then the union of M is the empty set.
Notations[edit]
The notation for the general concept can vary considerably. For a finite union of sets 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          S
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        
          S
          
            3
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          S
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{1},S_{2},S_{3},\dots ,S_{n}}
  
 one often writes 
  
    
      
        
          S
          
            1
          
        
        ∪
        
          S
          
            2
          
        
        ∪
        
          S
          
            3
          
        
        ∪
        ⋯
        ∪
        
          S
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{1}\cup S_{2}\cup S_{3}\cup \dots \cup S_{n}}
  
 or 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            n
          
        
        
          S
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{n}S_{i}}
  
. Various common notations for arbitrary unions include 
  
    
      
        ⋃
        
          M
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup \mathbf {M} }
  
, 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            A
            ∈
            
              M
            
          
        
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{A\in \mathbf {M} }A}
  
, and 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i\in I}A_{i}}
  
, the last of which refers to the union of the collection 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            
              A
              
                i
              
            
            :
            i
            ∈
            I
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{A_{i}:i\in I\right\}}
  
 where I is an index set and 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{i}}
  
 is a set for every 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in I}
  
. In the case that the index set I is the set of natural numbers, one uses a notation 
  
    
      
        
          ⋃
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigcup _{i=1}^{\infty }A_{i}}
  
 analogous to that of the infinite series.[7]
Whenever the symbol "∪" is placed before other symbols instead of between them, it is of a larger size.
