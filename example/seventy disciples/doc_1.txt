Epaphroditus, Sosthenes, Apollos, Cephas and Caesar


Cephas of Iconium is numbered among the Seventy Disciples, and was bishop of Iconium or Colophon, Pamphylia. The name "Cephas" is Aramaic for "Peter."[1]
The Church remembers St. Cephas on March 30 with Apostles Sosthenes, Apollos, Caesar, and Epaphroditus; and on December 8 with the same apostles and Onesiphorus. Apostles of the 70 were hand-picked (chosen) and sent by Jesus Christ himself to preach. They were chosen some time after the selection of the Twelve Apostles.[2] All seventy are commemorated by the Church on January 4.
