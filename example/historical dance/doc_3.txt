An American Ballroom Companion is an online collection of over two hundred social dance manuals at the Library of Congress related to the period of cca. 1490--1920. Along with social dance instruction manuals, this online presentation also includes a significant number of antidance manuals, histories, treatises on etiquette, information about theatrical dance.
The collection presents dance materials from various locations of the Library: General Collections, the Music Division, and the Rare Book and Special Collections Division.
The collection also presents a number of videoclips to illustrate the materials. The clips were recorded on several Library of Congress events starting from the 100th anniversary of the Library's Jefferson Building held in 1997.
