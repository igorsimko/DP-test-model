In Greek mythology, Autesion[1] – the son of Tisamenus, the grandson of Thersander and Demonassa and the great-grandson of Polynices and Argea – was a king of Thebes.
He is called the father of Theras and Argeia, by the latter of whom Aristodemus became the father of Eurysthenes and Procles. Autesion was a native of Thebes, where he had succeeded his father as king, but at the command of an oracle he went to Peloponnesus and joined the Dorians.[2]
