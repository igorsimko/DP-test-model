Cenotaph for Constantin Fahlberg in Magdeburg, Germany






Signature of Constantin Fahlberg


Constantin Fahlberg (22 December 1850 in Tambov – 15 August 1910 in Nassau, aged 59) discovered the sweet taste of anhydroorthosulphaminebenzoic acid in 1877–78 when analysing the chemical compounds in coal tar at Johns Hopkins University for Professor Ira Remsen (1846–1927, aged 81). Later Fahlberg gave this chemical "body" the trade name Saccharin.
