Early life[edit]
Harold Brodie was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada on December 3, 1907, and grew up there. After receiving his BSc from the University of Manitoba in 1929, he worked on his MSc under the direction of Arthur Henry Reginald Buller. In this research he investigated the functions of the oidia of the mushroom Coprinus lagopus (now known as Coprinopsis radiata); this research led to the two publications in 1931 and 1932.[1][2]
Awards[edit]
Brodie was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1952. He also received the Canada Centennial Medal in 1967, and the Lawson Medal of the Canadian Botanical Association in 1977.[3]
