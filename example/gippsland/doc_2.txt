History[edit]
Briagolong Post Office opened on 1 May 1871.[2]
The town's principal industry has been timber, and it supplied red gum paving blocks for Melbourne's streets, and stringybark for the flooring at Australia House in London.
The railway line from Maffra opened in 1889 and was closed in 1952.
Today[edit]
Briagolong was the home town of Private Jake Kovco, Australia's first military casualty in the Iraq War. The funeral for Private Kovco was held in the town on 2 May 2006, and was attended by Prime Minister John Howard, Defence Minister Brendan Nelson, Defence Force Chief Angus Houston and Army Chief Peter Leahy.
The town in conjunction with neighbouring township Boisdale has an Australian Rules football team Boisdale-Briagolong competing in the East Gippsland Football League.
The town's water supply is taken from the Freestone Creek.
Popular tourist areas nearby are the swimming areas on the Freestone Creek at Quarry Reserve, which is 4.5 km North of the town, and Blue Pool, which is 10 km north of the town, both on the Freestone Creek Road.
