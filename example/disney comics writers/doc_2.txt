Marco Rota (born September 18, 1942) is an Italian Disney comic artist who served as editor-in-chief of Disney Italia from 1974 to 1988.
Life and career[edit]
Rota was born in Milan. His first comic work, "Steve Morgan il trappolatore", was published in 1958 in the magazine Collana Scudo.[1] During the 1960s, he drew stories of Superman and Batman, as well as erotic comics.[1]
Rota made his first Disney comic using the Mickey Mouse character in 1971. He would go on, however, to work primarily with Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck stories. His most well-known Disney-related work is Andold "Wild Duck" Temerary, Donald's dark age Scottish alter ego; as well as the story From Egg To Duck (Italian: Happy Birthday Paperino, 1984), Donald's biography.[1]
In addition to working with established characters, Rota also does original work.[1] He currently works for the Danish publisher Egmont.[2]
