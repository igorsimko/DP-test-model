Math problem[edit]
Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time. The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on 12-hour clock.
A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal 12-hour analogue clock turns 360° in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5° per minute. The minute hand rotates through 360° in 60 minutes or 6° per minute.[1]

When are the hour and minute hands of a clock superimposed?[edit]




In this graphical solution, T denotes time in hours; P, hands' positions; and θ, hands' angles in degrees. The red (thick solid) line denotes the hour hand; the blue (thin solid) lines denote the minute hand. Their intersections (red circles) are when they align. Additionally, orange circles (dash-dot line) are when hands are in opposition, and pink circles (dashed line) are when they are perpendicular. In the SVG file, hover over the graph to show positions of the hands on a clock face.


The hour and minute hands are superimposed only when their angle is the same.

H is an integer in the range 0–11. This gives times of: 0:00, 1:05.45, 2:10.90, 3:16.36, 4:21.81, 5:27.27. 6:32.72, 7:38.18, 8:43.63, 9:49.09, 10:54.54, and 12:00. (0.45 minutes are exactly 27.27 seconds.)
