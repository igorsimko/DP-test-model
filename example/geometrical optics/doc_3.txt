An illustration of various conic constants


In geometry, the conic constant (or Schwarzschild constant,[1] after Karl Schwarzschild) is a quantity describing conic sections, and is represented by the letter K. For negative K it is given by


  
    
      
        K
        =
        −
        
          e
          
            2
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle K=-e^{2},}
  


where e is the eccentricity of the conic section.
The equation for a conic section with apex at the origin and tangent to the y axis is


  
    
      
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        −
        2
        R
        x
        +
        (
        K
        +
        1
        )
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle y^{2}-2Rx+(K+1)x^{2}=0}
  


where K is the conic constant and R is the radius of curvature at x = 0.
This formulation is used in geometric optics to specify oblate elliptical (K > 0), spherical (K = 0), prolate elliptical (0 > K > −1), parabolic (K = −1), and hyperbolic (K < −1) lens and mirror surfaces. When the paraxial approximation is valid, the optical surface can be treated as a spherical surface with the same radius.
Some non-optical design references use the letter p as the conic constant. In these cases, p = K + 1.
