Decomposition for smooth proper maps
The first case of the decomposition theorem arises via the hard Lefschetz theorem which gives isomorphisms, for a smooth proper map {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} f:X\to Y of relative dimension d between two projective varieties[1]

{\displaystyle -\cup \eta ^{i}:R^{d-i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}R^{d+i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ).} {\displaystyle -\cup \eta ^{i}:R^{d-i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}R^{d+i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ).}
Here {\displaystyle \eta } \eta  is the fundamental class of a hyperplane section, {\displaystyle f_{*}} f_{*} is the direct image (pushforward) and {\displaystyle R^{n}f_{*}} {\displaystyle R^{n}f_{*}} is the n-th derived functor of the direct image. This derived functor measures the n-th cohomologies of {\displaystyle f^{-1}(U)} f^{-1}(U), for {\displaystyle U\subset Y} {\displaystyle U\subset Y}. In fact, the particular case when Y is a point, amounts to the isomorphism

{\displaystyle -\cup \eta ^{i}:H^{d-i}(X,\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}H^{d+i}(X,\mathbb {Q} ).} {\displaystyle -\cup \eta ^{i}:H^{d-i}(X,\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}H^{d+i}(X,\mathbb {Q} ).}
This hard Lefschetz isomorphism induces canonical isomorphisms

{\displaystyle Rf_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}\bigoplus _{i=-d}^{d}R^{d+i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} )[-d-i].} {\displaystyle Rf_{*}(\mathbb {Q} ){\stackrel {\cong }{\to }}\bigoplus _{i=-d}^{d}R^{d+i}f_{*}(\mathbb {Q} )[-d-i].}
Moreover, the sheaves {\displaystyle R^{d+i}f_{*}\mathbb {Q} } {\displaystyle R^{d+i}f_{*}\mathbb {Q} } appearing in this decomposition are local systems, i.e., locally free sheaves of Q-vector spaces, which are moreover semisimple, i.e., a direct sum of local systems without nontrivial local subsystems.

Decomposition for proper maps
The decomposition theorem generalizes this fact to the case of a proper, but not necessarily smooth map {\displaystyle f:X\to Y} f:X\to Y between varieties. In a nutshell, the results above remain true when the notion of local systems is replaced by perverse sheaves.

The hard Lefschetz theorem above takes the following form: there is an isomorphism in the derived category of sheaves on Y:

{\displaystyle {}^{p}H^{-i}(Rf_{*}\mathbb {Q} )\cong {}^{p}H^{+i}(Rf_{*}\mathbb {Q} ),} {\displaystyle {}^{p}H^{-i}(Rf_{*}\mathbb {Q} )\cong {}^{p}H^{+i}(Rf_{*}\mathbb {Q} ),}
where {\displaystyle Rf_{*}} {\displaystyle Rf_{*}} is the total derived functor of {\displaystyle f_{*}} f_{*} and {\displaystyle {}^{p}H^{i}} {\displaystyle {}^{p}H^{i}} is the i-th truncation with respect to the perverse t-structure.

Moreover, there is an isomorphism

{\displaystyle Rf_{*}IC_{X}^{\bullet }\cong \bigoplus _{i}{}^{p}H^{i}(Rf_{*}IC_{X}^{\bullet })[-i].} {\displaystyle Rf_{*}IC_{X}^{\bullet }\cong \bigoplus _{i}{}^{p}H^{i}(Rf_{*}IC_{X}^{\bullet })[-i].}
where the summands are semi-simple perverse-sheaves, meaning they are direct sums of push-forwards of intersection cohomology sheaves.

If X is not smooth, then the above results remain true when {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} [\dim X]} {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} [\dim X]} is replaced by the intersection cohomology complex {\displaystyle IC} {\displaystyle IC}.

Proofs
The decomposition theorem was first proved by Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne.[2] Their proof is based on the usage of weights on l-adic sheaves in positive characteristic. A different proof using mixed Hodge modules was given by Saito. A more geometric proof, based on the notion of semismall maps was given by de Cataldo and Migliorini.[3]

For semismall maps, the decomposition theorem also applies to Chow motives.[4]

Applications of the Decomposition Theorem
Cohomology of a Rational Lefschetz Pencil
Consider a rational morphism {\displaystyle f:X\rightarrow \mathbb {P} ^{1}} {\displaystyle f:X\rightarrow \mathbb {P} ^{1}} from a smooth quasi-projective variety given by {\displaystyle [f_{1}(x):f_{2}(x)]} {\displaystyle [f_{1}(x):f_{2}(x)]}. If we set the vanishing locus of {\displaystyle f_{1},f_{2}} f_1,f_2 as {\displaystyle Y} Y then there is an induced morphism {\displaystyle {\tilde {X}}=Bl_{Y}(X)\to \mathbb {P} ^{1}} {\displaystyle {\tilde {X}}=Bl_{Y}(X)\to \mathbb {P} ^{1}}. We can compute the cohomology of {\displaystyle X} X from the intersection cohomology of {\displaystyle Bl_{Y}(X)} {\displaystyle Bl_{Y}(X)} and subtracting off the cohomology from the blowup along {\displaystyle Y} Y. This can be done using the perverse spectral sequence

{\displaystyle E_{2}^{l,m}=H^{l}(\mathbb {P} ^{1};{}^{\mathfrak {p}}{\mathcal {H}}^{m}(IC_{\tilde {X}}^{\bullet }(\mathbb {Q} ))\Rightarrow IH^{l+m}({\tilde {X}};\mathbb {Q} )\cong H^{l+m}(X;\mathbb {Q} )} {\displaystyle E_{2}^{l,m}=H^{l}(\mathbb {P} ^{1};{}^{\mathfrak {p}}{\mathcal {H}}^{m}(IC_{\tilde {X}}^{\bullet }(\mathbb {Q} ))\Rightarrow IH^{l+m}({\tilde {X}};\mathbb {Q} )\cong H^{l+m}(X;\mathbb {Q} )}
