Sandīpanī Muni was the guru of Lord Krishna. Sandīpanī was a rishi/muni/saint of Ujjain.
Sandīpanī means, "Possessor (ī) of complete (sam-) illuminating (-dīpana-)." The Saṅgīta-Sāra-Saṅgraha relates the name as a particular musical śruti (text).
The Sandīpanī Muni ashrama is located 2 km outside Ujjain, in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The area near the āśrama, known as Aṅkapāta, is popularly believed to have been the place used by Bhagavan Śrī Kṛṣṇa for washing his writing tablets. A locally sourced narrative relates that the numerals 1 to 100 found inscribed on a stone were originally engraved by Saṁdīpanī.
Near the ashrama is the Gomti Kund, a stepped water tank. Legend has it that this is where Krishna summoned all the holy waters from various centers so that his elderly Guru, Saṁdīpanī Muni would not have to travel other holy places.
The Bhāgavata Purāṇa relates the following story regarding Saṁdīpanī Muni:[1] While staying as students at the residence of Saṁdīpanī Muni, the two brothers— Shri Krishna and Balarāma— and their friend, Sudama (Su-dāma), mastered every single lesson, although only having been instructed in each once. Upon the rapid completion of their studies, they persuaded their teacher to ask for the preceptor’s dakhṣiṇa (his fee for providing instruction) of his own choosing. Saṁdīpanī asked for the restoration of his child, who had disappeared in the ocean at Prabhāsa (on the Western Coast Gujarat state of India, close to Somnath temple). The two brothers traveled to Prabhāsa and found that the son had been snatched away by a being named Shankhasura (literally, "conch demon"; In the Mahābhārata, Shankha is mentioned as one of Kubera's treasures, as well as the being presiding over it).
According to the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa , Shankhasura inhabited a beautiful conch named, panchajanya (IAST: pāñca-jana; literally, "Five-People," mentioned in the Aitireya Brāhmaṇa as the name of a group of inimical tribes, but which may also be connected with the constellation, Boötes, which resembles a conch shell), lived under the waters in the shape of a conch). Not finding the son within the conch, Shri Krishna and Balarama took the crom the clutches of Death-personified (Yama) that Shri Krishna acquired his famous conch, Pañca-Jana, from Shankhasura.
