In Japanese social science, seikatsu (生活) is similar to livelihood; the conscious and non-submissive activity of ordinary people in shaping their lives.[1] Its agents are seikatsusha (生活者), referring to ordinary people as distinct from the more rarefied concepts of "citizen" (shimin, 市民) or "member of the nation" (kokumin, 国民).[1] The study of seikatsu is an interdisciplinary field of the social sciences.[2]
