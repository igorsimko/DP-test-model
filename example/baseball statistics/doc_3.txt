An award share is a statistic in baseball, basketball and other sports. It is usually used as part of a formula to determine if a player will likely be elected to the Hall of Fame in his particular sport. It is calculated by the number of points a player received for a particular award over the total points of all first-place votes.[1] For example, in the 2000 NBA MVP race, Shaquille O'Neal received every first place vote but one (120 votes at ten points each), and one second place vote (seven points), and therefore his MVP award share for that season is 0.998 (1207/1210 max points). Cumulative award shares for a career are calculated by adding up all the award shares a particular player got throughout his career.
