Since 1998, there have been 30 teams in Major League Baseball (MLB). It is very rare for a pitcher to record a win against every team. In earlier times, two factors made it nearly impossible to defeat all teams in both leagues (even before expansion increased the number to 30):

Before the era of free-agency, in which players are free to move to another team at the end of their contract, a pitcher would play for only a few teams, and could not, of course, win a game against his own team.
Before inter-league play began in June 1997, a pitcher would see only half of the 30 teams in any single season, unless traded to a team in the other league. Even with inter-league play, a pitcher may not have his spot in a typical 5-man rotation match the games in the single 3- or 4-game series against another team, and only a few teams from the other league are played in any season.

In any case, defeating all teams is more likely only if a pitcher has a long career. Assuming a top notch pitcher manages to win against every team in a season, it will still only be 19 teams, unless he was traded. It is far more likely that his wins will come against 10 to 12 teams, most of which he has already beaten.
As of August 20, 2017, there have been 18 pitchers who have beaten all 30 teams. The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise with three players who accomplished the feat while on their roster: Randy Johnson, Barry Zito, and Tim Hudson.
