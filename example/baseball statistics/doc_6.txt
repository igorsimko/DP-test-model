Initial visibility
To set the template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used:

|state=collapsed: {{Baseball statistics|state=collapsed}} to show the template collapsed, i.e., hidden apart from its title bar
|state=expanded: {{Baseball statistics|state=expanded}} to show the template expanded, i.e., fully visible
|state=autocollapse: {{Baseball statistics|state=autocollapse}}

shows the template collapsed to the title bar if there is a {{navbar}}, a {{sidebar}}, or some other table on the page with the collapsible attribute
shows the template in its expanded state if there are no other collapsible items on the page



If the |state= parameter is not set, the template's initial visibility is taken from the |default= parameter in the template. For this template, that currently evaluates to autocollapse.
