History[edit]
RapidMiner, formerly known as YALE (Yet Another Learning Environment), was developed starting in 2001 by Ralf Klinkenberg, Ingo Mierswa, and Simon Fischer at the Artificial Intelligence Unit of the Technical University of Dortmund.[3] Starting in 2006, its development was driven by Rapid-I, a company founded by Ingo Mierswa and Ralf Klinkenberg in the same year.[4] In 2007, the name of the software was changed from YALE to RapidMiner. In 2013, the company rebranded from Rapid-I to RapidMiner.[5]
Description[edit]
RapidMiner uses a client/server model with the server offered as either on-premise, or in public or private cloud infrastructures.[6]
According to Bloor Research, RapidMiner provides 99% of an advanced analytical solution through template-based frameworks that speed delivery and reduce errors by nearly eliminating the need to write code. RapidMiner provides data mining and machine learning procedures including: data loading and transformation (Extract, transform, load (ETL)), data preprocessing and visualization, predictive analytics and statistical modeling, evaluation, and deployment. RapidMiner is written in the Java programming language. RapidMiner provides a GUI to design and execute analytical workflows. Those workflows are called “Processes” in RapidMiner and they consist of multiple “Operators”. Each operator performs a single task within the process, and the output of each operator forms the input of the next one. Alternatively, the engine can be called from other programs or used as an API. Individual functions can be called from the command line. RapidMiner provides learning schemas, models and algorithms and can be extended using R and Python scripts.[7]
RapidMiner functionality can be extended with additional plugins which are made available via RapidMiner Marketplace. The RapidMiner Marketplace provides a platform for developers to create data analysis algorithms and publish them to the community.[8]
With version 7.0, RapidMiner included updates to its getting started materials, an updated user interface, and improvements to its data preparation capabilities.[9]
Adoption[edit]
In 2018, Gartner Research placed RapidMiner in the leader quadrant of its Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms. The report highlighted RapidMiner's "Wisdom of Crowds" guidance for recommended next steps in a predictive analytics process in addition to overall ease of use.[10] In the 2017 and 2016 annual software poll KDnuggets ranked RapidMiner as one of the most popular data analytics software with the poll’s respondents citing the software package as the tool they use.[11][12] RapidMiner received one of the strongest satisfaction ratings in the 2011 Rexer Analytics Data Miner Survey.[13] RapidMiner has received millions of total downloads and has over 250,000 users including BMW, Intel, Cisco, GE, and Samsung as paying customers. RapidMiner claims to be the market leader in the software for data science platforms against competitors such as SAS and IBM.[14]
Developer[edit]
About 50 developers worldwide participate in the development of the open source RapidMiner with the majority of the contributors being employees of RapidMiner.[15] The company that develops RapidMiner received a $16 million Series C funding with participation from venture capital firms Nokia Growth Partners, Ascent Venture Partners, Longworth Venture Partners, Earlybird Venture Capital and Open Ocean Capital. Open Ocean partner Michael "Monty" Widenius is a founder of MySQL.
