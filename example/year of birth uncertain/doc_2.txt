Double mayor[edit]
Due to a new law that had been passed in the Puerto Rico Legislature the previous year (1902), which annexed the municipality of Guayanilla to the municipality of Ponce, Antonio Arias was, in effect, the mayor of Guayanilla as well during his one-year term as mayor of Ponce. Once no longer a mayor of Ponce, Arias returned to Guayanilla to oversee that municipality in the unofficial post as Guayanilla's mayor. The law was repealed in 1905, after which Guayanilla elected its own mayor again.[1]
Resignation[edit]
Arias resigned his post on 23 June 1904.[2]
