If they are identical mirrors, their radius of curvature, R<sub>mirror</sub>, equals L, where L is the distance between the mirrors.\n\n* In conic sections, it is said of two ellipses, two hyperbolas, or an ellipse and a hyperbola which share both foci with each other. If an ellipse and a hyperbola are confocal, they are perpendicular to each other.\n\n* In optics, it means that one focus or image point of one lens is the same as one focus of the next lens.\n\n==See also==\n*Confocal laser scanning microscopy*Confocal microscopy\n\nCategory:Elementary geometryCategory:Optics\n\nde:Konfokaleo:Samfokusait:Confocale","category":"Elementary_geometry"},{"page_id":80611,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}An Athenian temple to Demeter, the Eleusinion was the place where all sacred objects associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries were kept between ceremonies.
