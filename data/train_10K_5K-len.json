It may have been preceded by an optional \"pre-answer\" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.\n\nThe answer establishes which allegations (cause of action in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's defenses, thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the court.\n\nIn a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before defendant comes to court. The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either guilty or not guilty.

It may have been preceded by an optional \"pre-answer\" motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.\n\nThe answer establishes which allegations (cause of action in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant's defenses, thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the court.\n\nIn a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before defendant comes to court. The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either guilty or not guilty.

In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A supreme court is therefore itself a kind of appellate court. Appellate courts worldwide can operate by varying rules. For example, the Isle of Man's traditional local appellate court is the Staff of Government Division which has only two Justices, titled \"Deemsters,\" whose decisions are joined to the original trial decision. They almost always have a majority, if either Deemster agrees with the trial Judge.\n\n==Institutional titles==\nMany US jurisdictions title their appellate court a Court of Appeal or Court of Appeals. Historically, others have titled their appellate court a Court of Errors (or Court of Errors and Appeals), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the Connecticut Supreme Court), the Kentucky Court of Errors (since renamed the Kentucky Supreme Court), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the Supreme Court of Mississippi). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an Appellate Division.\n\nDepending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on the one hand, and appeals from the Court of Federal Claims on the other.\n\n==Authority to review==\nThe authority of appellate courts to review a decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review. For example, in the United States, both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the court below made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were. Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.\n\nIn most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of discretionary review, meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*Court of Criminal Appeals*Court of Criminal Appeal (disambiguation)\n\nCategory:Courts\n\ncs:Odvolací soudde:Appellationsgerichtes:Tribunal de apelaciónit:Corte d'appello (Italia)ja:高等裁判所pl:Sąd apelacyjnypt:Tribunal de apelação","category":"Courts"},{"page_id":643,"parsed_text":"{{redirect4|Court of Appeal|Court of Appeals}}{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}{{globalize/USA}}\n\nAn appellate court is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal.

In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a plea. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include \"guilty\", \"not guilty\", and the peremptory pleas (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed.

The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each individual charge. This process is the same in Australian jurisdictions. \n\nIn the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest. During this arraignment the defendant is informed of any pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge will also decide whether or not to set bail, and, if so, for how much money. The second arraignment is called a post-indictment arraignment or PIA. It is during this second arraignment that a defendant will be allowed to enter a plea.\n\n==Form of the arraignment==\n\nThe wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, however, generally conforms with the following principles:<br /># The accused person (defendant) is addressed by name;<br /># The charge against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time and place of offence; and,<br /># The accused person is asked formally how they plead.\n\n==Guilty and not guilty pleas==\nIf the defendant pleads guilty, an evidentiary hearing usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge will assess the offense, mitigating factors, and the defendant's character, and pass sentence. If the defendant pleads not guilty, a date will be set for a preliminary hearing or a trial.\n\nIn the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or \"stood mute\") would be subject to peine forte et dure (Law French for \"strong and hard punishment\"). Today in common law jurisdictions, defendants who refuse to enter a plea will have a plea of not guilty entered for them by the court.

This is of importance since the validity of an argument is determined solely by its form. The sentence forms which classify argument forms of common important arguments are studied in logic.\n\n== Example ==\nTo demonstrate the important notion of the form of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.;Original argument:All humans are mortal.:Socrates is human.:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.;Argument Form:All S are P.:a is S.:Therefore, a is P.\n\nAll we have done in the Argument form is to put 'S' for 'human' and 'humans', 'P' for 'mortal', and 'a' for 'Socrates'; what results, is the form of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the Argument form is the sentence form of its respective sentence in the original argument.\n\n==Importance==\nAttention is given to argument and sentence form, because form is what makes an argument valid or cogent. Some examples of valid argument forms are modus ponens, modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, hypothethical syllogism and dilemma. Two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* Analytic proposition* logical form* List of invalid argument forms* List of valid argument forms* Synthetic proposition\n\n{{logic-stub|date=November 2008}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Argument Form}}Category:Arguments\n\npt:Forma de um argumento","category":"Arguments"},{"page_id":684,"parsed_text":"Agatho may refer to:\n\n*Pope Agatho, a pope of the Catholic Church*Pope Agatho of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark*Agatho, the martyred son of Hor and Susia==See also==*Agathos - Greek language for \"good\"{{given name}}\n\n{{hndis}}\n\nde:Agathofi:Agathon","category":"Given_names"},{"page_id":764,"parsed_text":"{{wikify|date=February 2010}}{{italictitle}}{{Taxobox| name = Agnostida| fossil_range = Early Cambrian – Late Ordovician| image = Peronopsis.jpg| image_width = 200px| image_caption = Peronopsis interstrictus| image2 = agnostus-pisiformis.png| image2_caption = Agnostus pisiformis| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Arthropoda| classis = Trilobita| ordo = Agnostida| ordo_authority = Salter, 1864| subdivision_ranks = Families| subdivision =Suborder Agnostina* Superfamily Agnostoidea** Agnostidae** Ammagnostidae** Clavagnostidae** Diplagnostidae** Doryagnostidae** Glyptagnostidae** Metagnostidae** Peronopsidae** Ptychagnostidae** Spinagnostidae* Superfamily Condylopygoidea** CondylopygidaeSuborder Eodiscina* Superfamily Eodiscoidea** Calodiscidae** Eodiscidae** Hebediscidae** Tsunyidiscidae** Weymouthiidae** Yukoniidae}}\n\nAgnostida is an order of trilobite which first developed near the end of the Early Cambrian period and thrived during the Middle Cambrian.

Most agnostid species were eyeless.\n\nThe systematic position of Order Agnostida within Class Trilobita remains uncertain, and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a stem group. The challenge to the status has focused on the Agnostina partly because juveniles of one genus have been found with legs greatly different from those of adult trilobites, suggesting they are separately descended from Crustaceans.

Their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. They likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. In contrast, their wide geographic dispersion in the fossil record is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence.

An abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. The abstract also records all deeds, wills, mortgages, and other documents that affect ownership of the property. An abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.\n\n==Clear Title==\n{{Law unref section|date=November 2007}}A Clear Title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. It reveals no breaks in the chain of legal ownership. After the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. In a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. After this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.\n\n== Patent law ==\n\nIn the context of patent law and specifically in prior art searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to novelty or inventive step (or non-obviousness in United States patent law) of an invention. Under United States patent law, the abstract may be called \"Abstract of the Disclosure\".\n\n== Administrative process ==\nCertain government bureaucracies, such as a department of motor vehicles will issue an abstract of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. This is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.\n\n== Notes ==\n {{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*Property abstract\n\n==References==\n* World Book encyclopedia 1988\n\n== External links ==\n* {{PCT Rule|8}}, defining the requirements regarding the abstract in an international application filed under Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)* {{EPC Article|85}} and {{EPC Rule|47}} (previously {{EPC 1973 Rule|33}}), defining the abstract-related requirements in a European patent application\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abstract (Law)}}Category:Legal research\n\n{{law-term-stub}}","category":"Legal_research"},{"page_id":779,"parsed_text":"The anthophytes were thought to be a clade comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.

Since early 1989, Aztlan Underground has played Rapcore. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.\n\nThis unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.\n\nThe artists are Chenek \"DJ Bean\" (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe \"Peps\" (bass, rattles), Alonzo Beas (guitars, synth), Caxo (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).\n\nAztlan Underground appeared on television on Culture Clash on Fox in 1993, was part of Breaking Out, a concert on pay per view in 1998, and was featured in the independent films Algun Dia and Frontierlandia.\n\nThe band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the Vancouver Sun, Northshore News (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), New Times (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), BAM Magazine (Southern California), La Banda Elastica Magazine, and the Los Angeles Times Calendar section.

Since early 1989, Aztlan Underground has played Rapcore. Indigenous drums, flutes, and rattles are commonplace in its musical compositions.\n\nThis unique sound is the backdrop for the band's message of dignity for indigenous people, all of humanity, and Earth. Aztlan Underground has been cultivating a grass roots audience across the country, which has become a large and loyal underground following. Their music includes spoken word pieces and elements of punk, hip hop, rock, funk, jazz, and indigenous music, among others.\n\nThe artists are Chenek \"DJ Bean\" (turntables, samples and percussion), Yaotl (vocals, indigenous percussion), Joe \"Peps\" (bass, rattles), Alonzo Beas (guitars, synth), Caxo (drums, indigenous percussion), and Bulldog (vocals, flute).\n\nAztlan Underground appeared on television on Culture Clash on Fox in 1993, was part of Breaking Out, a concert on pay per view in 1998, and was featured in the independent films Algun Dia and Frontierlandia.\n\nThe band has been mentioned or featured in various newspapers and magazines: the Vancouver Sun, Northshore News (Vancouver, Canada newspaper), New Times (Los Angeles weekly entertainment newspaper), BLU Magazine (underground hip hop magazine), BAM Magazine (Southern California), La Banda Elastica Magazine, and the Los Angeles Times Calendar section.

In 1909 he commenced clinical work under the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and did laboratory work with Franz Nissl and Alois Alzheimer in Munich.\n\nIn 1911 he went to Hamburg to work with Theodor Kaes and became head of the laboratory of anatomical pathology at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as prosector. After serving in the German army in World War I, he returned to Hamburg and climbed the academic ladder. He was habilitated in neurology in 1919 and in 1924 became professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made notable contributions to knowledge on concussion and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of neuropathology.\n\nJakob published five monographs and more than 75 papers. His neuropathological studies contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia. He first recognised and described Alper's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (the latter with Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt). He accumulated immense experience in neurosyphilis, having a 200-bedded ward devoted exclusively to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States and South America where he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of yellow fever.\n\nHe suffered from chronic osteomyelitis for the last 7 years of his life.

(Anguish is its Latinate equivalent.) It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of strife. The term Angst distinguishes itself from the word Furcht (German for \"fear\") in that Furcht usually refers to a material threat (arranged fear), while Angst is usually a nondirectional emotion.\n\nIn other languages having the meaning of the Latin word pavor, the derived words differ in meaning, e.g. as in the French anxiété and peur. The word Angst has existed since the 8th century, from the Proto-Indo-European root *anghu-, \"restraint\" from which Old High German angust develops. It is pre-cognate with the Latin angustia, \"tensity, tightness\" and angor, \"choking, clogging\"; compare to the Greek \"άγχος\" (ankhos): stress.\n\n==Existentialism==\nExistentialist philosophers use the term \"angst\" with a different connotation. The use of the term was first attributed to Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813&ndash;1855). In The Concept of Anxiety (also known as The Concept of Dread, depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word Angest (in common Danish, angst, meaning \"dread\" or \"anxiety\") to describe a profound and deep-seated spiritual condition of insecurity and fear in the free human being. Where the animal is a slave to its instincts but always conscious in its own actions, Kierkegaard believed that the freedom given to people leaves the human in a constant fear of failing his/her responsibilities to God. Kierkegaard's concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for 20th-century existentialism. While Kierkegaard's feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to God, in modern use, angst was broadened by the later existentialists to include general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self, one's principles, and others (possibly including God). Martin Heidegger used the term in a slightly different way.\n\nAngst is very often misused in today's society as a synonym for anger.\n\n==Classical music==\nAngst in serious musical composition has been a reflection of the times. Musical composition embodying angst as a primary theme have primarily come from European Jewish composers such as Gustav Mahler and Alban Berg, written during a period a great persecution of the Jewish people shortly before and during European Nazi rule. A notable exception is the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich whose symphonies use the theme of angst in post-World War II compositions depicting Russian strife during the war. However, it is the Jewish artists, Gustav Mahler and Franz Kafka in music and literature that have embraced the theme of angst so highly in their work that they have become synonymous with the term to the point of popular joking and cartoons today. \n\nAngst appears to be absent from important French music. Erik Satie’s Gymnopédie and Maurice Ravel’s Pavane pour une infante défunte, composed before World War II, reflect melancholy sentiment without angst in soft, quiet compositions. The effect of angst is achieved by Shostakovich, Mahler and Berg in compositions of wide dynamic range, at times seemingly spinning out of control (Mahler), and atonal music using the twelve-tone row method of composition (Berg and others) to create an angst ridden atmosphere of grotesque sound. The theme of angst is portrayed in Mahler's Symphony No. 6 (\"The Tragic\") and in Alban Berg's poignant Violin Concerto, dedicated to \"To the memory of an angel\", for the death of friend Gustav Mahler’s daughter.\n\n==See also==\n*Anguish*Anxiety*Anger*Existentialism*Alienation*Byronic hero, an archetypal \"rebel\" in literature, described by Byron in 1812, with attitudes similar to those with angst in modernity.*Kafkaesque*Weltschmerz*Fear of death*Terror management theory{{Emotion-footer}}\n\n{{Kierkegaard}}\n\nCategory:German loanwordsCategory:AnxietyCategory:EmotionsCategory:Existentialism\n\nar:يأسcy:Angstde:Angstes:Angsteo:Angorofr:Angoisseio:Angoroit:Angosciahe:ייאושja:恐怖nl:Angstsk:Zúfalstvouk:Розпачzh:畏","category":"Anxiety"},{"page_id":921,"parsed_text":"{{unreferenced|date=August 2009}}{{otheruses}}\n\nAngst is a German, Danish, Norwegian and Dutch word for fear or anxiety.

Kierkegaard's concept of angst is considered to be an important stepping stone for 20th-century existentialism. While Kierkegaard's feeling of angst is fear of actual responsibility to God, in modern use, angst was broadened by the later existentialists to include general frustration associated with the conflict between actual responsibilities to self, one's principles, and others (possibly including God). Martin Heidegger used the term in a slightly different way.\n\nAngst is very often misused in today's society as a synonym for anger.\n\n==Classical music==\nAngst in serious musical composition has been a reflection of the times. Musical composition embodying angst as a primary theme have primarily come from European Jewish composers such as Gustav Mahler and Alban Berg, written during a period a great persecution of the Jewish people shortly before and during European Nazi rule. A notable exception is the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich whose symphonies use the theme of angst in post-World War II compositions depicting Russian strife during the war. However, it is the Jewish artists, Gustav Mahler and Franz Kafka in music and literature that have embraced the theme of angst so highly in their work that they have become synonymous with the term to the point of popular joking and cartoons today. \n\nAngst appears to be absent from important French music. Erik Satie’s Gymnopédie and Maurice Ravel’s Pavane pour une infante défunte, composed before World War II, reflect melancholy sentiment without angst in soft, quiet compositions. The effect of angst is achieved by Shostakovich, Mahler and Berg in compositions of wide dynamic range, at times seemingly spinning out of control (Mahler), and atonal music using the twelve-tone row method of composition (Berg and others) to create an angst ridden atmosphere of grotesque sound. The theme of angst is portrayed in Mahler's Symphony No. 6 (\"The Tragic\") and in Alban Berg's poignant Violin Concerto, dedicated to \"To the memory of an angel\", for the death of friend Gustav Mahler’s daughter.\n\n==See also==\n*Anguish*Anxiety*Anger*Existentialism*Alienation*Byronic hero, an archetypal \"rebel\" in literature, described by Byron in 1812, with attitudes similar to those with angst in modernity.*Kafkaesque*Weltschmerz*Fear of death*Terror management theory{{Emotion-footer}}\n\n{{Kierkegaard}}\n\nCategory:German loanwordsCategory:AnxietyCategory:EmotionsCategory:Existentialism\n\nar:يأسcy:Angstde:Angstes:Angsteo:Angorofr:Angoisseio:Angoroit:Angosciahe:ייאושja:恐怖nl:Angstsk:Zúfalstvouk:Розпачzh:畏","category":"Emotions"},{"page_id":921,"parsed_text":"{{unreferenced|date=August 2009}}{{otheruses}}\n\nAngst is a German, Danish, Norwegian and Dutch word for fear or anxiety.

The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.\n\nThe French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.\n\nHoward Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.\n\nCategory:Film techniques\n\nde:Einstellungsgrößefr:Plan américainpl:Plan amerykańskipt:Plano americano","category":"Film_techniques"},{"page_id":1021,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=December 2007}}{{otheruses}}{{Wiktionarypar|aspect ratio}}\n\nThe aspect ratio of a shape is the ratio of its longer dimension to its shorter dimension. It may be applied to two characteristic dimensions of a three-dimensional shape, such as the ratio of the longest and shortest axis, or for symmetrical objects that are described by just two measurements, such as the length and diameter of a rod. The aspect ratio of a torus is the ratio of the major axis R to the minor axis r.\n\n==Applications and uses==\nThe term is most commonly used with reference to:*graphic / image**image aspect ratio**computer display standard**paper size**standard photographic print sizes**standard ad size**pixel aspect ratio**photolithography: in photolithographic applications, the aspect ratio of an etched or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.

An amateur receives little or irregular income from their activities, and thus differs from a professional who makes a living from the pursuit and typically has formal training and certifications in the domain. The term, deriving from words for \"lover\", reflects a voluntary motivation to work as a result of personal interest in the activity. As a value system, amateurism elevates things done with self-interest or for their own intrinsic value above those done for pay. The term has particular currency in its usage with regard to sports.\n\nAmateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often do not have formal training, some amateur work may be sub-par. For example, amateur athletes in sports such as basketball or football are not regarded as having the same level of ability as professional athletes. On the other hand an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.\n\nThe lack of financial recompense can also be seen as a sign of commitment to an activity; and until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs. Receiving payment to participate in an event disqualified an athlete from that event, as in the case of Jim Thorpe. In the Olympics, this rule remains in place for boxing.\n\nMany amateurs make valuable contributions in the field of computer programming through the open source movement. Amateur dramatics is the performance of plays or musical theater, often to high standards but lacking the budgets of professional West End or Broadway performances. Astronomy, history, linguistics, and ornithology are among the myriad fields that have benefited from the activities of amateurs.\n\n== See also ==\n* Volunteer* Hobby* Amateur astronomy* Amateur radio* Amateur sports\n\n== Notes ==\n* Bourdieu, P.

consists of four major units:*1st Battalion, Antigua and Barbuda Regiment - this is the infantry unit and fighting arm of the defence force. *Service and Support Unit - established in 1997, this provides administrative, logistic and engineer support to the rest of the defence force.*Coast Guard - this is the maritime element of the defence force, and is divided into four units:**Commanding Officer's office**Engineer Unit**Administration Unit**Flotilla - the flotilla is the operational part of the Coast Guard, and consists of four vessels.*Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps\n\nThe RABDF has responsibility for several different roles: internal security, prevention of drug smuggling, the protection and support of fishing rights, prevention of marine pollution, search and rescue, ceremonial duties, assistance to government programs, provision of relief during natural disasters, assistance in the maintenance of essential services and support of the police in maintaining law and order.\n\nThe RABDF is the world's smallest military, consisting of 245 people. It is thus much better equipped for fulfilling its civil roles as opposed to providing a deterrence against would-be aggressors or in defending the nation during a war.\n\n==Former Deployments==\n\n* In 1982 14 men of the Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force were deployed to Grenada during the Operation Urgent Fury.* 1990 12 soldiers were sent to Trinidad after a failed coup attempt by radical Black Muslims against the constitutionally elected government headed by Prime Minister A.N.R.

Therefore the usual order relation ≤ on the real numbers, the subset order ⊆ on the subsets of any given set and the divisibility order of the natural numbers are antisymmetric. For example, if for two real numbers x and y both inequalities x&nbsp;≤&nbsp;y and y&nbsp;≤&nbsp;x hold then x and y must be equal.\n\nA relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric (e.g., the equality relation), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the preys-on relation on biological species).\n\nAntisymmetry is different from asymmetry. According to one definition of asymmetric, anything that fails to be symmetric is asymmetric. Another definition of asymmetric makes asymmetry equivalent to antisymmetry plus irreflexivity.\n\n==Examples==\nThe relation \"x is even, y is odd\" between a pair (x, y) of integers is antisymmetric::::Image:Evenandodd.PNG\n\n==See also==\n* Symmetry in mathematics\n\n==References==\n*{{MathWorld | urlname=AntisymmetricRelation | title=Antisymmetric Relation}}\n\nCategory:Mathematical relations\n\ncs:Antisymetrická relacede:Antisymmetriees:Relación antisimétricaeo:Malsimetria rilatofa:رابطه پادمتقارنko:반대칭관계he:אנטי סימטריותhu:Antiszimmetrikus relációja:反対称関係pl:Relacja antysymetrycznaru:Антисимметричное отношениеsk:Antisymetrická reláciauk:Антисиметричне відношенняzh:反对称关系","category":"Mathematical_relations"},{"page_id":1189,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}}{{Redirect|Articles of Faith|the punk band|Articles of Faith (band)}}Articles of faith are sets of beliefs usually found in creeds, sometimes numbered, and often beginning with \"We believe...\", which attempt to more or less define the fundamental theology of a given religion, and especially in the Christian Church.\n\n==Articles of the apostles==\nThe earliest articles of faith were said to have been composed in the first century by the apostles themselves and sung publicly while on mission (see Old Roman Symbol).\n\n==Articles of Nicea==\nThe Nicene Creed and the shorter Apostles' Creed are articles, or professions of Faith said by members of the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.\n\nThe Nicene Creed is predominantly recited during the mass while the Apostles' is typically used for other occasions, healings, etc. It strongly asserts belief in the Holy Trinity, the incarnation, the nativity, the passion of Christ, the resurrection, the atonement, the judgement of the living.\n\n==Articles of Chalcedon==\nThe articles of the Chalcedonian Creed reaffirm belief in the dyophysitism of Christ : two natures, one co-substantial person.\n\n==The Thirty Nine Articles==\n\nThe Thirty-Nine Articles are the historic defining statements of English christian doctrine.\n\n==Other articles and creeds==\nThe confession of faith of Westminster is one of many evangelical creeds that give articles of faith based on sola scriptura rather than on the living experience of the Church.

Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways. See also cultural movements. \n\n== Artistic revolution and cultural/political revolutions ==\n\nThe role of fine art has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescenience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their 'talent' of seeing. \n\nArtists have had to 'see' issues clearly in order to satisfy their current clients, yet not offend potential patrons. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 1600s when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.\n\nExamples of revoutionary art in conjunction with cultural/political movements:\n\n*Trotskyist & Diego Rivera*Black Panther Party & Emory Douglas*Cuban Poster art*Social realism & Ben Shahn*Feminist art & the Guerrilla Girls*Industrial Workers of the World & Woody Guthrie\n\n== Artistic revolution of style ==\n\nBut not all artistic revolutions were political. Revolutions of style have also abruptly changed the art of a culture. For example, when the careful, even tedious, art techniques of French neo-classicism became oppressive to artists living in more exuberant times, a stylistic revolution known as \"Impressionism\" vitalized brush strokes and color. Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir burst onto the French culture, effecting a revolution with a style that has become commonplace today.\n\nAn artistic revolution can be begun by a single artist, but unless that artist gains some understanding, he becomes an iconoclast. The first Abstract Expressionists were considered madmen to give up their brushes and rely on the sheer force of energy to leave an image, but then the import of atomic bombs, all atomic energy, became realized, and art found no better way of expressing its power. Jackson Pollock is the artist best known for starting that revolution.\n\nCategory:Art history\n\n{{art-movement-stub}}Category:Articles lacking sources from June 2009Category:All articles lacking sources","category":"Art_history"},{"page_id":1202,"parsed_text":"{{Original research|article|date=June 2009}}\n\nAn applet is any small application that performs one specific task; sometimes running within the context of a larger program, perhaps as a plugin.

Examples of applications often classified as applets are all of the Accessories in Microsoft Windows (such as Windows Notepad or Microsoft Paint).Applets are not full featured application programs.\n\n===Applet as extension of other Software===\nIn some cases, an applet does not run independently. Such applets must run in a container, which is provided by a host program, through a plugin, or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model. Applets are usually included by using the statement import java.applet.Applet{{refneeded|date=July 2009}}\n\nExamples of Web-based Applets include:* QuickTime movies * Flash movies. * Windows Media Player applets are used to display embedded video files in Internet Explorer (and other browsers that support the plugin). * 3D-modelling display applets allows a view of a model to be rotated and zoomed. * Browser games can be applet-based, though some may develop into fully functional applications that require installation.\n\n=====Applet vs Subroutine=====\nA larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:{{refneeded|date=July 2009}}* Applets execute only on the \"client\" platform environment of a system, as contrasted from \"servlet\".

Such systems are examples of argots à clef, or \"coded argots.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionarypar|argot}}* Bargoens* Caló (Chicano)* Cant* Fala dos arxinas* Fenya* Gayle language* Jargon* Klezmer-loshn* Language game* Lingo* Louchébem* Lunfardo* Nadsat* Rotwelsch* Slang* Verlan* Vernacular\n\nCategory:Cant languagesCategory:Folklore\n\nbr:Luc’hajbg:Таен говорcs:Argotda:Argotde:Argotes:Argotfr:Argotid:Argotit:Argotka:არგოტიზმიhu:Tolvajnyelvnl:Argotja:業界用語pl:Slangpt:Argotro:Argouru:Аргоsk:Argotsl:Argo (zvrst jezika)sv:Argotuk:Арґо","category":"Folklore"},{"page_id":1270,"parsed_text":"thumbExtreme poverty is the most severe state of poverty. Many cannot meet basic needs for food, water, shelter, sanitation, and health care. To determine the affected population, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than USD $1.25 per day (adjusted for PPP). The World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion people currently live under these conditions.\n\nIn 1996, the following definition taken from Joseph Wresinski, founder of ATD Fourth World was taken up by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Despouy Report on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty s:The Despouy Report on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty.\n\n<blockquote>\"The lack of basic security connotes the absence of one or more factors enabling individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental rights. The situation may become widespread and result in more serious and permanent consequences. The lack of basic security leads to chronic poverty when it simultaneously affects several aspects of people’s lives, when it is prolonged and when it severely compromises people’s chances of regaining their rights and of reassuming their responsibilities in the foreseeable future.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe eradication of extreme poverty and hunger was the first Millennium Development Goal, as set by 179 United Nations Member States in 2000. Economists and activists consider epidemic diseases (AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis) as crucial factors in and consequences of extreme poverty.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}\n\nExtreme poverty is most common in Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.

Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see stomach, kidney, liver, etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. appendicitis). \n\n== Types ==\nThe three most common abdominal surgeries are described below. \n\n*Exploratory Laparotomy -- This refers to the opening of the abdominal cavity for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or trauma. It may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem. \n\n*Appendectomy -- Surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the appendix. Typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure. \n\n*Laparoscopy -- A minimally invasive approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. The tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure. The laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional \"open\" cholecystectomy.\n\n== Complications ==\nComplications of abdominal surgery include * bleeding, * infection, * post-surgical adhesions* shock, and * ileus, or more commonly Paralytic ileus (short-term paralysis of the bowel)\n\nSterile technique, aseptic post-operative care, antibiotics, and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications. Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions. The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.\n\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Abdominal surgery}}\n\n==See also== *Abdominoplasty*ASA physical status classification system or perioperative physical fitness*Diabetes*General Surgery*Perioperative mortality\n\n==References==\n{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}}\n\nCategory:Surgical specialties\n\nde:Viszeralchirurgieit:Chirurgia addominalept:Cirurgia do aparelho digestivosh:Abdominalna kirurgija","category":"Surgical_specialties"},{"page_id":1305,"parsed_text":"{{Expand German|topic=geo|date=March 2009}}{{Infobox German Location|Art = Stadt|Wappen = Wappen Abensberg.png|lat_deg = 48 |lat_min = 48| lat_sec=0|lon_deg = 11 |lon_min = 51| lon_sec=0|Lageplan = Abensberg - Lage im Landkreis.png|Lageplanbeschreibung =|Bundesland = Bayern|Regierungsbezirk = Niederbayern|Landkreis = Kelheim|Höhe = 370|Fläche = 60.28|Einwohner = 12561|Stand = 2006-12-31|PLZ = 93326|Vorwahl = 09443|Kfz = KEH|Gemeindeschlüssel = 09 2 73 111|NUTS = DE226|LOCODE = DE ABE|Gliederung = 7 Ortsteile|Adresse = Stadtplatz 1<br />93326 Abensberg|Website = [http://www.abensberg.de/ www.abensberg.de]|Bürgermeister = Uwe Brandl|Partei = CSU}}\n\nAbensberg ({{IPA-de|ˈaːbənsˌbɛʁk}}) is a town in Bavaria, Germany on the Abens, a tributary of the Danube, 18 m.

A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the sword of Saint George (patron saint of Catalonia), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>Image:Casa Batllo.jpg|The Casa Batlló by dayImage:Jfader batto roof.jpg|The arched roof and complex chimney detailingImage:Casa batllo chimney.jpg|Close-up of a chimneyImage: staircase casa batllo.jpg|The unique design of the staircase and ceilingImage: Close up Casa Batlo.JPG| Close-up of Casa Batlló</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kubic.cat/kc/full_screen/fotografia-virtual-barcelona-13.html Virtual Tour (inmersive photography) to Casa Batlló]*[http://www.casabatllo.cat The official website of La Casa Batlló]*[http://miejsca.org/2007/casa-batllo-barcelona-antonio-gaudi/ Photographs of the inside of La Casa Batlló]*[http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Casa_Batllo.html Casa Batlló on GreatBuildings.com]*[http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/albums-en/gaudi-casa-batllo/index.html Casa Batlló pictures]*[http://www.op.net/~jmeltzer/Gaudi/batllo.html Casa Batlló description]*gaudi designer [http://www.gaudidesigner.com/uk/casa-batllo.html]*[http://www.touristguides-barcelona.com/casabattlo.html GAUDI CASA BATTLO in tourist guides-BARCELONA]\n\n{{commons}}\n\n{{Barcelona landmarks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Casa Batllo}}Category:Visionary environmentsCategory:Buildings and structures in BarcelonaCategory:Modernisme in BarcelonaCategory:Antoni Gaudí buildingsCategory:1907 architectureCategory:World Heritage Sites in SpainCategory:Visitor attractions in BarcelonaCategory:EixampleCategory:Passeig de Gràcia\n\nca:Casa Batllóde:Casa Batllóes:Casa Batllóeu:Batlló Etxeafr:Casa Batllógl:Casa Batllóhr:Casa Batllóit:Casa Batllóhe:קאזה באליוlb:Casa Batllóhu:Casa Batllónl:Casa Batllója:カサ・バトリョno:Casa Batllópl:Casa Batllópt:Casa Batllóru:Дом Бальоsr:Каса Батљоfi:Casa Batllósv:Casa Batllóuk:Будинок Бальоzh:巴特洛公寓","category":"World_Heritage_Sites_in_Spain"},{"page_id":1331,"parsed_text":"{{BLPsources|date=August 2008}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist | Name = Arabian Prince| Img =| Img_capt = | Landscape = | Background = solo_singer| Birth_name = Mik Lezan| Alias = Professor X| Born = | Died = | Origin = Compton, California| Instrument = | Genre = Hip hop| Occupation = rapper, disc jockey| Years_active = 1983 {{ndash}} present| Label = Ruthless Records<br> Macola Records<br>Orpheus Records<br>Da Bozak Records<br/>Clone Records <br/>Stones Throw Records| Associated_acts = N.W.A, Egyptian Lover, Bobby Jimmy & the Critters| URL = | Current_members = | Past_members = | Notable_instruments = }}Arabian Prince is the stage name of Mik Lezan, a rapper and hip hop producer, best known for being an original member of the rap group, N.W.A. \n\n==Biography==\nHe started working with Bobby Jimmy & the Critters in 1984.

Ain Zarba; mod. Anavarza) was an ancient Cilician city, situated in Anatolia in modern Turkey, in the present Çukurova (or classical Aleian plain) about 10 miles west of the main stream of the present Ceyhan River (or classical Pyramus river) and near its tributary the Sempas Su.\n\nA lofty isolated ridge formed its acropolis. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the Suda's identification of it with Cyinda, famous as a treasure city in the wars of Eumenes of Cardia, cannot be accepted in the face of Strabo's express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.\n\nUnder the early Roman empire the place was known as Caesarea, and was the metropolis of Cilicia Secunda. Rebuilt by the emperor Justin I after an earthquake, it became Justinopolis (525); but the old native name persisted, and when Thoros I, king of Lesser Armenia, made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as Anazarva.\n\nIts great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which debouched from the Cilician Gates, made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the Byzantine Empire and the early Muslim invaders. It had been rebuilt by Harun al-Rashid in 796, refortified at great expense by Saif ad-Daula, the Hamdanid (10th century) and sacked, and ruined by the crusaders.\n\nThe present wall of the lower city is of late construction, probably Armenian. It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine triumphal arch, the colonnades of two streets, a gymnasium, etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside on the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock; but beyond ruins of two churches and a fine tower built by Thoros I. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equalled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine aqueducts to their sources.\n\nA visit in December, 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.\n\n== Notable people ==\n*Pedanius Dioscorides (1st century) Greek physician, pharmacologist and botanist\n\n{{Commons|Category:Anazarbus}}==References==* {{Wikisource1911Enc Citation}}* {{Suda}}\n\n{{coord|37|15|50|N|35|54|20|E|display=title|region:TR-01_type:landmark_source:dewiki}}\n\nCategory:CiliciaCategory:Ancient Greek sites in TurkeyCategory:Roman sites in TurkeyCategory:Former settlements in Turkey\n\nar:عين زربةca:Anazarbede:Anazarbafr:Anazarbeit:Anazarbepl:Anazarbusru:Аназарбfi:Anazarbatr:Anavarza Kalesi","category":"All_pages_needing_cleanup"},{"page_id":1360,"parsed_text":"{{cleanup|date=March 2008}}{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n\nthumbthumbAnazarbus in Ancient Cilicia (Adana) (med.

Hero and Leander's story was been near Abydos. \n\nAbydos was first mentioned in the catalogue of Trojan allies (Iliad ii.836). It probably was a Thracian town, as Strabo has it, but was afterwards colonized by Milesians, with the consent of Gyges, king of Lydia, around 700 BC. It was occupied by the Persians in 514 BC, and Darius burnt it in 512. Here Xerxes built two bridges of boats and crossed the strait in 480 BC when he invaded Greece.\n\nAbydos thereafter became a member of the Delian League, until it revolted from Athenian rule in 411 BC. It allied itself to Sparta, until 394 BC; King Agesilaus of Sparta crossed here while returning to Greece. Abydos then passed under Achaemenid rule, until 334 BC. Alexander the Great threw a spear to Abydos while crossing the strait and claimed Asia as his own.\n\nAbydos is celebrated for the vigorous resistance it made against Philip V of Macedon in 200 BC, and is famed in myth as the home of Leander. It minted coins from the early fifth century BC to the mid-third century AD. \n\nThe town remained until late Byzantine times an important toll and customs station of the Hellespont, its importance thereafter being transferred to the Dardanelles, after the building of the \"Old Castles\" by Sultan Mehmet II (c. 1456).\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Additional sources===\n*{{1911}}*[http://icarus.umkc.edu/sandbox/perseus/pecs/page.14.a.php Richard Stillwell, ed.

Its width varies from 50 to 200&nbsp;yards, and its depth from 3 to 40 feet. Its length as measured by the United States Geological Survey is 312&nbsp;miles (502&nbsp;km), and by steamboat measurement, 420&nbsp;miles (676&nbsp;km). \n\nThe river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state, and railways connect it with the mineral regions of north central Alabama. \n\nAfter the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the Cahaba River, which is about 200&nbsp;miles (300&nbsp;km) long and joins the Alabama River about 10&nbsp;miles (16&nbsp;km) below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from Rome, Georgia, to about 117&nbsp;miles (188&nbsp;km) above Wetumpka (about 102&nbsp;miles below Rome and 26&nbsp;miles (42&nbsp;km) below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government. \n\nThe navigation of the Tallapoosa River –- which has its source in Paulding County, Georgia, and is about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) long -– is prevented by shoals and a 60-foot (18&nbsp;m) fall at Tallassee, a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.\n\nThe river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.\n\nThe Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the Creek Indians before their removal in the early 19th century.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://reference.allrefer.com/gazetteer/A/A02218-alabama-river.html Allrefer.com]*[http://Alabamamilebymile.com Alabamamilebymile.com] features an online map of the Alabama River between Selma and Tallassee including navigational, recreational and cultural landmarks.

This battle was part of a civil war between David and Ishbosheth, the son of Saul. After this battle Abner switched to the side of David and granted him control over the tribe of Benjamin.

Her mother was Agnes of Rochlitz. She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers.\n\nIn June 1196 Agnes married Philip II of France, who had repudiated his second wife Ingeborg of Denmark in 1193. Pope Innocent III espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, nine months after interdict had been added to excommunication, he consented to a separation from Agnes. She died broken-hearted in July of the next year, at the castle of Poissy, and was buried in the Convent of St Corentin, near Nantes.

The genus is native from east Asia south to northern Australasia.\n\nThey are fast-growing deciduous trees growing to 25-45 m tall, with spreading branches and large (40-100 cm) pinnate leaves with 15-41 long pointed leaflets, the terminal leaflet normally present, and the basal pairs of leaflets often lobed at their bases. The small yellow to greenish flowers are borne on branched panicles. They turn reddish later in the year and eventually brown. They stay on the tree for a long time; the male flowers have a strong odour. The odour tends to resemble the smell of strong cat urine or the spray of a male cat. Also, touching the leaves leaves an unpleasant smell on the hands. The fruit is a samara drawn out into a long wing with the seed in the middle. The wood is fine grained and satiny. \n\n==Species==\n\nThe number of species is disputed, with some authorities accepting up to ten species, while others accept six or fewer. Species include:*Ailanthus altissima (Tree of Heaven) – northern and central mainland China, Taiwan, arguably the best known species.*Ailanthus excelsa – India and Sri Lanka*Ailanthus integrifolia – New Guinea and Queensland, Australia*Ailanthus malabarica – southeast Asia*Ailanthus triphysa (White Siris) – northern and eastern Australia*Ailanthus vilmoriniana (Downy Tree of Heaven) – southwest China \n\nThis is considered an invasive species in North America. Ailanthus is capable of forming thick blankets of roots and heavy shade to the extent that native species are prevented from being able to reclaim an area that has been logged or deforested, as well as areas that have been heavily developed.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}\n\nIn spite of being an invasive species on many places, this tree often grows where no others will. Thus it does not replace native species or more desirable trees and may only compete with weeds which have little value.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}\n\nA silk spinning moth, the Ailanthus silkmoth (Samia cynthia), lives on Ailanthus leaves, and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk, but inferior to it in fineness and gloss.

He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in Athens after the departure of Pheidias for Olympia, but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies. \n\n==References==\n*Andrew Stewart, One hundred Greek Sculptors : Their Careers and Extant Works ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0008%3Ahead%3D%2333 on-line])*{{1911}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Alcamenes}}*[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/vor?lang=en&full=0&alts=1&group=typecat&lookup=Alcamenes Alcamenes]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alcamenes}}Category:Pergamene sculptureCategory:5th-century BC Greek sculptorsCategory:Ancient Greek sculptorsCategory:Ancient Athenian sculptorsCategory:Ancient LemnosCategory:Metics in Classical AthensCategory:People from Lemnos\n\nca:Alcàmenes d'Atenesde:Alkamenesel:Αλκαμένηςes:Alcámenesfr:Alcamènegl:Alcamenesit:Alcamenehu:Alkamenésznl:Alcamenes (beeldhouwer)pt:Alcamenessl:Alkamenesuk:Алкамен із Лемноса","category":"Pergamene_sculpture"},{"page_id":1580,"parsed_text":"Alcidamas, of Elaea, in Aeolis, Greek sophist and rhetorician, flourished in the 4th century BC.\n\nHe was the pupil and successor of Gorgias and taught at Athens at the same time as Isocrates, whose rival and opponent he was. We possess two declamations under his name: On Sophists, directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); Odysseus, in which Odysseus accuses Palamedes of treachery during the siege of Troy (this is generally considered spurious).\n\nAccording to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking extempore on every conceivable subject. Aristotle (Rhet. iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.\n\nOf other works only fragments and the titles have survived: Messeniakos, advocating the freedom of the Messenians and containing the sentiment that \"all are by nature free\"; a Eulogy of Death, in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a Techne or instruction-book in the art of rhetoric; and a Phusikos logos. Lastly, his Mouseion (a word invoking the Muses) seems to have contained the narrative of the Contest of Homer and Hesiod, of which the version that has survived is the work of a grammarian in the time of Hadrian, based on Alcidamas. This hypothesis of the contents of the Mouseion, originally suggested by Nietzsche (Rheinisches Museum 25 (1870) & 28 (1873)), appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus finds - one 3rd century BC (Flinders Petrie Papyri, ed.

Against this, the Averroists, led by Agostino Nifo, introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again. These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.\n\nThe Alexandrists, led by Pietro Pomponazzi, boldly assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle. They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason. Hence the Alexandrists denied the possibility of any form of immortality, holding that, since the soul is organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former. \n\n==References==\n*{{1911}}Category:Christian philosophy\n\nes:Alejandristassk:Renesanční alexandristi","category":"Christian_philosophy"},{"page_id":1637,"parsed_text":"\"Hymn to Proserpine\" is a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in 1866.

On May 28, 585 BC, during the Battle of Halys fought against Cyaxares, king of Media, a solar eclipse took place (see also Thales); hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the Halys fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.\n\nAlyattes drove the Cimmerians (see Scythia) from Asia, subdued the Carians, and took several Ionian cities (Smyrna, Colophon). (Smyrna was sacked and destroyed c.600 BC, the inhabitants forced to move to the country.)\n\nHe standardised the weight of coins (1 Stater = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with the Lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Croesus. His daughter Aryenis of Lydia was Queen consort of Astyages, King of Media.\n\nHis tomb still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the river Hermus to the north of Sardis&mdash;a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones. It was excavated by Spiegelthal in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely-cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The sarcophagus and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb, all that was left being some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large phalli of stone.\n\n==Naming disagreement==\n\nNote that the name \"Alyattes II\" is likely incorrect. Its usage here is based on the online [http://lexicorient.com/e.o Encyclopaedia of the Orient]. Though this online work provides no references, its usage of \"Alyattes II\" is likely based on John Lemprière's 1788 Classical Dictionary (Biblioteca Classica), its full name being Classical Dictionary of Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors Writ Large, With Chronological Table. This work, however, also doesn't cite its source, but this source was likely ancient epigraphs or later works whose usage was based on ancient epigraphs, which are lists of kings on clay tablets and other media.\n\nEpigraphic lists, however, are known by historians today to be generally unreliable as historical documents. For one thing, they sometimes combine kings from different regions. [http://www.metrum.org/gyges Livio C. Stecchini] contended, for instance, that Gyges was the first Lydian king and those before him, including the earlier Alyattes, were kings of nearby Maionia, a Phrygian dependency. What's more, epigraphic lists are often legendary rather than annalistic, including, for instance, the mythic hero Herakles as a city's founder or people's progenitor, as they do for the Lydians, so another possibility is that \"Alyattes I\" was a legendary rather than a historical figure.\n\nThe ancient historians Herodotos and Strabo both refer to Croeusus' father as Alyattes and make no mention of an earlier King Alyattes of Lydia in their writings on Lydia. The same is true of modern historians, archeologists, and numismatists who have focused on Lydia, including George M.A. Hanfmann, John Griffiths Pedley, Robert W.

In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university, and, on a personal appeal to Pope Innocent III, the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.\n\nHis death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.In 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris, and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds. The doctrines of his followers, known as the Amalricians, were formally condemned by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215.\n\n==Propositions==\nAmalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from Eriugena, whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly pantheistic form.\n\nThree propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:\n\n#that God is all (omnia sunt deus) and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus);#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.\n\nBecause of the first proposition, God himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation.\n\nThese three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch Abraham, marking the epoch of the Father; the second in Jesus Christ, who began the epoch of the Son; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the era of the Holy Ghost.\n\nAmalricians taught: \n\nHell is ignorance, therefore Hell is within all men, \"like a bad tooth in a mouth\"; \n\nGod is identical with all that is, even evil belongs to God and proves God's omnipotence;\n\nA man who knows that God works through everything cannot sin, because every human act is then the act of God;\n\nA man who recognizes the truth that God works through everything is already in Heaven and this is the only resurrection. There is no other life; man's fulfilment is in this life alone.\n\nDue to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder.

He conquered the Kingdom of Majorca between his succession and 1287.\n\nHe was a son of Peter III of Aragon and his Queen consort Constantia of Sicily, daughter and heiress of Manfred of Sicily. His maternal grandmother Beatrice of Savoy was a daughter of Amadeus IV of Savoy and Anne of Burgundy.\n\nSoon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the Balearic Islands into the Kingdom of Aragon - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, James I of Aragon. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, James II of Majorca, and conquered both Majorca (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the Kingdom of Majorca. He followed this with the conquest of Minorca - until then, an autonomous Muslim state (Manûrqa) under the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Minorca's national holiday.\n\nHe initially sought to maintain the Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to island of his brother, James II of Aragon. However, he later pressed his brother to retract the claims and instead supported claim from the Papal States.\n\nHis reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the Union of Aragon - the so called \"Magna Carta of Aragon\", which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.\n\nDuring his lifetime a dynastic marriage with Princess Eleanor of England , daughter of King Edward I of England, was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 27 in 1291, and was buried in Franciscan convent at Barcelona; since 1852 his remains are buried in Barcelona Cathedral.\n\nDante Alighieri, in the Divine Comedy, recounts that he saw Alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of Purgatory with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of Europe during the 13th century.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Alighieri, Dante, Purgatorio, Canto VII, l. 115ff.*Nelson, Lynn.

He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an avocation.\n\nFrom 1850 onwards he became well-known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his History of Music, which was published at intervals from 1862 in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by Otto Kade and Wilhelm Langhans. \n\nAmbros was professor of the history of music at Prague from 1869 to 1871. Also in Prague, he seated on the board of governors in the Prague Royal Conservatory. By 1872, he was living in Vienna and was employed by the Department of Justice as an officer and by Prince Rudolf's family as his tutor. Through his work in Vienna, he was given leave of absence for half the year in order to let him travel the world to collect musical information to include in his History of Music book. He was an excellent pianist, and the author of numerous compositions somewhat reminiscent of Felix Mendelssohn.\n\nAmbros died at Vienna, Austria at the age of 59.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n== References ==\n* {{1911}}* {{CE|August Wilhelm Ambros}}{{See also|Ambros}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ambros, August Wilhelm}}Category:1816 birthsCategory:1876 birthsCategory:People from MýtoCategory:Austrian composersCategory:Romantic composersCategory:Austrians of Bohemian German descent\n\n{{Austria-composer-stub}}\n\nca:August Wilhelm Ambrosde:August Wilhelm Ambrosit:August Wilhelm Ambrospt:August Wilhelm Ambrossv:August Wilhelm Ambros","category":"Romantic_composers"},{"page_id":1702,"parsed_text":"Alredus, or Alfred of Beverley, English chronicler, was sacristan of the church of Beverley in the first half of the 12th century. \n\nHe wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a chronicle entitled Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae, which begins with Brutus and carries the history of England down to 1129. \n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth and Simeon of Durham are Alured's chief sources. \n\n----{{DNB Poster|Alfred of Beverley}}{{1911}}\n\nCategory:12th-century historiansCategory:Middle English literatureCategory:English historiansCategory:12th-century English people\n\n{{UK-historian-stub}}","category":"English_historians"},{"page_id":1702,"parsed_text":"Alredus, or Alfred of Beverley, English chronicler, was sacristan of the church of Beverley in the first half of the 12th century. \n\nHe wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a chronicle entitled Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae, which begins with Brutus and carries the history of England down to 1129. \n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth and Simeon of Durham are Alured's chief sources. \n\n----{{DNB Poster|Alfred of Beverley}}{{1911}}\n\nCategory:12th-century historiansCategory:Middle English literatureCategory:English historiansCategory:12th-century English people\n\n{{UK-historian-stub}}","category":"Middle_English_literature"},{"page_id":1714,"parsed_text":"Autpert Ambrose (Ambroise) (ca. 730 – 784) ({{lang-la|Ambrosius Autpertus}}), was a Frankish Benedictine monk.\n\nHe became abbot of San Vicenzo on the Volturno in South Italy in the time of Desiderius, king of the Lombards.

We know little more of the life of Andronicus, but he is of special interest in the history of philosophy, from the statement of Plutarch, that he published a new edition of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, which formerly belonged to the library of Apellicon, and were brought to Rome by Sulla with the rest of Apellicon's library in 84 BC. Tyrannion commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it. The arrangement which Andronicus made of Aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of Aristotle's works.\n\nAndronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the Physics, Ethics, and Categories. None of these works is extant. Two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one On Emotions, the other a commentary on Aristotle's Ethics (really by Constantine Palaeocapa in the 16th century, or by John Callistus of Thessalonica).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* F.

He was the son of Raymond IV of Toulouse by his third wife, Elvira of Castile, was born in the castle of Mont-Pelerin, Tripoli, in today's Lebanon. He was born while his father was on crusade, attempting to create the County of Tripoli on the Palestinian coast. He was surnamed Jordan after being baptised in the Jordan River. \n\nHis father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, Guillaume Jourdain, count of Cerdagne (d. 1109), until he was five. He was then taken to Europe and his brother Bertrand gave him the county of Rouergue. In his tenth year, upon Bertrand's death (1112), he succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence, but Toulouse was taken from him by William IX, count of Poitiers, in 1114, who claimed it by right of his wife Philippa of Toulouse, daughter of William IV of Toulouse. He recovered a part in 1119, but continued to fight for his possessions until about 1123.

Molecules which are modified to gain new catalytic activity are called synzymes. Abzymes are usually artificial constructs, but are also found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where they can bind to and hydrolyze DNA. Abzymes are potential tools in biotechnology, e.g., to perform specific actions on DNA.\n\nEnzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state, thereby catalyzing the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between reactants and products. If an antibody is developed to a stable molecule that's similar to an unstable intermediate of another (potentially unrelated) reaction, the developed antibody will enzymatically bind to and stabilize the intermediate state, thus catalyzing the reaction. A new and unique type of enzymes is produced.\n\n==HIV treatment==\n\nIn a June 2008 issue of the journal Autoimmunity Reviews, researchers S Planque, Sudhir Paul, Ph.D, and Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Ph.D of the University Of Texas Medical School at Houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the gp120 CD4 binding site. This is the one part of the HIV virus outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to T lymphocytes, the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat. The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this protein gp120 is necessary for the HIV virus to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population. \n\nThe abzyme does more than bind to the site, it actually destroys the site, rendering the HIV virus inert, and then can attach to other viruses. A single abzyme can destroy thousands of HIV viruses. Human clinical trials will be the next step in producing treatment and perhaps even preventative vaccines and microbicide\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{HIVpharm}}\n\nCategory:Monoclonal antibodies\n\n{{enzyme-stub}}\n\nca:Abzimde:Abzymees:Abzimafr:Abzymeit:Abzimahe:נוגדן קטליטיja:抗体酵素pl:Abzymyru:Абзимыuk:Абзимzh:抗体酶","category":"Monoclonal_antibodies"},{"page_id":1916,"parsed_text":"{{About|a type of chromosome|the ancestral discovery method using autosomal DNA|Genealogical DNA test#Geographic origin tests}}\n\nAn autosome is a chromosome that is not a sex chromosome – that is to say there are an equal number of copies of the chromosome in males and females.

Nothing is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of Marie of Troyes, and probably of French origin; he is sometimes known by a French translation of his name, André le Chapelain.\n\n==His work==\nDe Amore was written at the request of Marie de Champagne, daughter of King Louis VII of France and of Eleanor of Aquitaine. A dismissive allusion in the text to the \"wealth of Hungary\" has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when Bela III of Hungary had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's sister Marguerite of France, but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted. \n\nJohn Jay Parry, the editor of De Amore, quotes critic Robert Bossuat as describing \"De Amore\" as \"one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization\". It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.\n\nThe social system of \"courtly love\", as gradually elaborated by the Provençal troubadours from the mid twelfth century, soon spread. One of the circles in which this poetry and its ethic were cultivated was the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, William IX of Aquitaine). It has been claimed that De Amore codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1170 and 1174, though it was evidently written at least ten years later and, apparently, at Troyes. It deals with several specific themes that were the subject of poetical debate among late twelfth century troubadours and trobairitz.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Andreas Capellanus: The Art of Courtly Love, trans.

They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water, and are especially frequent in lakes and rivers, but a few are found in marine and soil habitats as well. Each actinophryid are unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, without any shell or test, and with many pseudopodia supported by axopods radiating outward from the cell body, which adhere to passing prey and allows it to roll or float about. The outer portion of the cell, or ectoplasm, is distinct and is filled with many tiny vacuoles, which assist in flotation. This is very similar to the process of osmosis. The movement of water from inside the cell to the outside is not because of water concentration in this case. It is the cell pushing the excess water out. A few contractile vacuoles around the periphery of the cell expel excess water, and are visible as clear bulges when full.\n\nThere are two genera included here. Actinophrys have a single, central nucleus. Most are around 40-50 μm in diameter, with axopods up to 100 μm in length, though this varies. Actinosphaerium are several times larger, from 200-1000 μm in diameter, with many nuclei, and are found exclusively in fresh water. Two other genera, Echinosphaerium and Camptonema, have been described but appear to be synonyms.\n\nReproduction takes place by fission, with open mitosis. Under unfavourable conditions, the organism will form a cyst, which is multi-walled and covered in spikes. While encysted it may undergo a peculiar process of autogamy or self-fertilization, where it goes through meiosis and divides to form two gametes, which then fuse together again. This is the only form of sexual reproduction that occurs within the group, though it is really more genetic reorganization than reproduction.\n\nThe axopods are supported by microtubules arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern. In Actinophrys, these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in Actinosphaerium some do and others don't. Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and it now appears that the actinophryids developed from axodines such as Pedinella. These are specialized heterokont algae, related to golden algae, diatoms, brown algae, and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.\n\nAs far as the diet of the Actinophyrys goes, the protist feeds on small flagellates, diminutive cilates, microscopic algae, etc.\n\n{{Heterokont}}Category:HeterokontsCategory:Amoeboids\n\nes:Actinophryidasr:Actinophryidaetr:Actinophrys","category":"Amoeboids"},{"page_id":1986,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=October 2007}}\n\n{{Taxobox| name = Actinophryids| domain = Eukaryota| regnum = Chromalveolata| phylum = Heterokontophyta| classis = Actinochrysophyceae| ordo = Actinophryida| ordo_authority = Hartmann 1913| subdivision_ranks = Genera| subdivision = Actinophrys<br />Actinosphaerium| image=20090816_204618_Actinophryid.jpg}}The actinophryids are small, familiar group of heliozoan protists.

A technician will call a local ANAC's phone number. This number connects to a computer at a local central office, which uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to \"speak\" the phone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow phone company technicians to identify which telephone line they are connected to. Because this system is based on automatic number identification (not caller ID) and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted numbers and numbers with caller ID blocking.\n\nSome ANACs are very regional or local in scope, while others are state-/province- or area-code-wide. There appears to be no consistent national system for them. Every telephone company (big or small) can determine its own ANAC for each individual central office, leading to a mish-mash of overlapping and/or spotty coverage. \n\nIn most North American area codes, 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx exchanges are reserved for various local and long-distance test purposes (a few may also reserve 999-xxxx); ANAC numbers sometimes appear in the 958-xxxx range but there is no requirement that they reside there. Other local test numbers may include ringback (to test the ringer when installing telephones) and loop lines (which connect a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). Some carriers (such as Bell Canada) have been known to program payphones to disable calls to 958 or 959 test lines.\n\nSome large telephone companies have toll-free numbers set up, but these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse.\n\nIn early years some companies changed their ANAC number every month for secrecy. In one example of this concern, most payphones are assigned a telephone number and can ring if the number is called. The phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone, making it potentially useful for anonymous criminal activity such as drug dealing. Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number could be discovered by calling an ANAC service.\n\nLate in the 20th century, caller ID and prepaid cellphone service became commonplace. These services being more easily exploited for criminal purposes, this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern.\n\nThere are some private national toll-free numbers that use ANI and then have a computer read back the number that is calling, but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer's own phone number. They are used in order for the agent in the call center to confirm the phone the customer is calling from, so that a computer can automatically display the customer's account on a \"screen pop\" for the next available customer service representative. However, if one were to call one of these numbers, listen for the number confirmation and hang up, they would in effect be using this system as if it were an ANAC. One such toll-free ANAC service is one owned by MCI - 1-800-444-4444. This number is easy to remember and, when called, will read back your number after a very short message. However, a suspended or out of service line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll-free numbers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\nCategory:Telephone numbersCategory:Telephony signals","category":"Telephone_numbers"},{"page_id":2061,"parsed_text":"An automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) is a special telephone number that is meant to be used by phone company technicians and other telecommunications technicians to determine the phone number of a particular line. \n\nThe way an ANAC works is fairly simple.

They can be joined by single bonds (alkanes), double bonds (alkenes), or triple bonds (alkynes). Besides hydrogen, other elements can be bound to the carbon chain, the most common being oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. \n\nThe simplest aliphatic compound is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Aliphatics include alkanes (e.g. paraffin hydrocarbons), alkenes (e.g. ethylene) and alkynes (e.g. acetylene). Fatty acids consist of an unbranched aliphatic tail attached to a carboxyl group. \n\nMost aliphatic compounds are flammable, allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel, such as methane in Bunsen burners, and acetylene in welding.\n\n==Examples==\n<gallery>Image:Ethane.png|EthaneImage:Isobutane.png|IsobutaneImage:Acetylene-2D.png|Acetylene</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Aromatic compound* Carbon-carbon bond\n\n==References==\n\nCategory:Organic compounds\n\nar:مركب أليفاتيca:Hidrocarbur alifàticcs:Alifatická sloučeninada:Alifatisk forbindelsede:Aliphatische Kohlenwasserstoffeel:Αλειφατική ένωσηes:Hidrocarburo alifáticofr:Composé aliphatiqueid:Senyawa alifatikit:Composti alifaticihe:אליפטיותnl:Alifatische verbindingno:Alifatisk forbindelsepl:Związki alifatycznept:Composto alifáticoru:Алифатические соединенияsk:Alifatický uhľovodíksl:Alifatska spojinafi:Alifaattinen yhdistesv:Alifatiskth:สารประกอบแอลิแฟติกuk:Аліфатичні сполукиvi:Hợp chất aliphaticzh:脂肪族化合物","category":"Organic_compounds"},{"page_id":2125,"parsed_text":"In abstract algebra, a field extension L/K is called algebraic if every element of L is algebraic over K, i.e. if every element of L is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K.

Criticism of perceived academic elitism may or may not target intellectuals in general, academic institutions or education itself, but always targets present leadership, practices and/or policies in academia.\n\nAnti-intellectuals often perceive themselves as champions of ordinary people and populism against elitism, especially academic elitism. These critics argue that highly educated people form an isolated social group and tend to dominate political discourse in higher education (academia). Another criticism is that universities tend more to pseudo-intellectualism than intellectualism per se; for example, to protect their positions and prestige, academics may over-complicate problems and express them in obscure language. \n\n== Description ==\nAcademic elitism suggests that in highly competitive academic environments only those individuals who have engaged in scholarship are deemed to have anything worthwhile to say, or do. It suggests that individuals who have not engaged in such scholarship are cranks.\n\nAcademic elitism is also an ideological belief that only those who attended the most elite or prestigious universities (such as Ivy League schools, Grandes Ecoles or Oxbridge) are capable of obtaining wealth and power. Proponents of academic elitism justify this belief by claim that this is just a by-product of capitalism {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.\n\nEconomist Dan Klein shows that the worldwide top-35 economics departments pull 76 percent of their faculty from their own graduates. He argues that the academic culture is pyramidal, not polycentric, and resembles a closed and genteel social circle. Meanwhile it draws on resources from taxpayers, foundations, endowments, and tuition payers, and it judges the social service delivered. The result is a self-organizing and self-validating circle.\n\n==See also==\n*Academia*Anti-intellectualism*Anti-intellectualism in American Life (book)*Elitism*Graduate Record Examination*Intelligence quotient*Ivory Tower*Liberal Elite*Model Minority\n\n== References ==\n\n{{No footnotes|date=October 2008}}=== Notes==={{reflist}}\n\n==External references==\n\n;Published articles* {{cite book | ref=harv | last= Adams | first=Mike S. | year=2004 | title=Welcome to the Ivory Tower of Babel: Confessions of a Conservative College Professor | publisher=Harbor House | isbn=1-891799-17-7}}* {{cite journal | ref=harv | last=Bair | first=Jeffrey H. | last2=Boor | first2=Myron | year=1991 | title=The Academic Elite in Law: Linkages Among Top-Ranked Law Schools | journal=Psychological Reports | volume=68 | pages=891-94}}* {{cite journal | ref=harv | last=Bair | first=Jeffrey H. | year=2003 | title=The Academic Elite in Law: Linkages Among Top-Ranked Law Schools | journal=The American Journal of Economics and Sociology | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_2_62/ai_100202314}}* Keally, Charles T., \"[http://www.t-net.ne.jp/~keally/Reports/SIR2006/sir2006.html Academic Elitists and Elite Academics: An Essay]\".

It is named after Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.\n\nThe Abbe number V of a material is defined as\n\n:<math>V = \\frac{ n_D - 1 }{ n_F - n_C },</math>\n\nwhere n<sub>D</sub>, n<sub>F</sub> and n<sub>C</sub> are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the Fraunhofer D-, F- and C- spectral lines (589.2 nm, 486.1&nbsp;nm and 656.3&nbsp;nm respectively). Low dispersion (low chromatic aberration) materials have high values of V.\n\nAbbe numbers are used to classify glass and other optically transparent materials. For example, flint glass has V&nbsp;<&nbsp;50 and crown glass has V&nbsp;>&nbsp;50. Typical values of V range from around 20 for very dense flint glass, around 30 for polycarbonate plastics, and up to 65 for very light crown glass, and up to 85 for fluor-crown glass.

When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of energy. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted photon, the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. This second ejected electron is called an Auger electron.\n\nUpon ejection the kinetic energy of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial electronic transition and the ionization energy for the electron shell from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. Auger electron spectroscopy involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either X-rays or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. Auger recombination is a similar Auger effect which occurs in semiconductors. An electron and electron hole (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as impact ionization.\n\nThe name \"Auger effect\" comes from one of its discoverers, Pierre Victor Auger, and not from the similarly-named device, the auger.\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe Auger emission process was discovered in the 1920s by Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist. The Auger effect was discovered in 1925 by Pierre Victor Auger upon analysis of a Wilson cloud chamber experiment. High energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe photoelectric electrons. Observation of electron tracks independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an internal conversion of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation and theoretical work showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect by use of elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate and transition probability calculations.

The population is 59,241 (est. 2007), showing a growth of 45% from 1985 to 2005. The city is the capital of Abadehy County.\n\nIt is the largest city in the Abadeh-Eghlid district, which is famed for its carved wood-work, made of the wood of pear and box trees. Sesame oil, castor oil, grain, and various fruits are also produced there.\n\nThe area is famous for its Abadeh rugs.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Roads===\nExpessway 65 passes through Abadeh. This situation helps Abadeh to improve compared to Eqlid. Road 78 runs from 25&nbsp;km southern Abadeh from Yazd to Yasuj. A road starts from Abadeh Ring Road to Soqad and Semirom, Road 55.\n\n===Railroad===\nA rail road from Isfahan to Shiraz was planed and started to be constructed in 2002. One week before Iranian presidential election, 2009, for electional reasons by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but after the first train moved from Shiraz to Abadeh in 7 hours (it was supposed to pass this way in 2 hours!) passengers went to Isfahan by bus.

Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of Miass in the Ilmen mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks. More recently, high-quality crystals have been obtained from Pike's Peak, Colorado, where it is found associated with smoky quartz, orthoclase, and albite in a coarse granite or pegmatite. Crystal Peak, Teller County, Colorado is a well-known locality for crystals of amazonite. Some other localities in the United States yield amazonite, and it is also found in pegmatite in Madagascar and in Brazil.\n\nBecause of its bright green colour when polished, amazonite is sometimes cut and used as a gemstone, although it is easily fractured.\n\nFor many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Naturally, many people assumed the color was due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors. More recent studies suggest that the blue-green color results from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar.

He later worked in Amsterdam (1614), Bergen op Zoom (1615&ndash;1616), Utrecht (1616&ndash;1619), and Breda (1619). He specialised in painting still lifes with flowers. In 1587, Ambrosius Bosschaert moved from Antwerp to Middelburg with his family because of the threat of religious persecution. At the age of twenty-one, he joined the city’s Guild of Saint Luke.

Examples are the RS-232C serial standard, and MNP2 and V.2 modems and older.\n\n== Data link layer and higher ==\nAsynchronous communication at the data link layer or higher protocol layers is known as statistical multiplexing or packet mode communication, for example asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). In this case the asynchronously transferred blocks are called data packets, for example ATM cells. The opposite is circuit switched communication, which provides constant bit rate, for example ISDN and SONET/SDH.\n\nThe packets may be encapsulated in a data frame, with a frame synchronization bit sequence indicating the start of the frame, and sometimes also a bit synchronization bit sequence, typically 01010101, for identification of the bit transition times. Note that at the physical layer, this is considered as synchronous serial communication. Examples of packet mode data link protocols that can be/are transferred using synchronous serial communication are the HDLC, Ethernet, PPP and USB protocols.\n\n== Application layer ==\n{{Original research|date=September 2007}}An asynchronous communication service or application does not require a constant bit rate.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Examples are file transfer, email and the World Wide Web. An example of the opposite, a synchronous communication service, is realtime streaming media, for example IP telephony, IP-TV and video conferencing.\n\n== Asynchronous communication in an electronically mediated environment ==\nAsynchronous communication is a mediated form of communication in which the sender and receiver are not concurrently engaged in communication.\n\n==See also==\n* Asynchronous serial communication* Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)* Plesiochronous* Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH)* Asynchronous system* Asynchronous circuit* Asynchrony* Anisochronous* Baud rate\n\nCategory:CommunicationCategory:SynchronizationCategory:Telecommunications terms\n\nbg:Асинхронна комуникацияgl:Comunicación asíncronafi:Asynkroninen kommunikaatio","category":"Telecommunications_terms"},{"page_id":2520,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=January 2010}}{{Mergeto|Natural number#algebraic properties|discuss=talk:Natural number#merger|date=January 2010}}Addition of natural numbers is the most basic arithmetic binary operation. The operation addition takes two natural numbers, the augend and addend, and produces a single number, the sum. The set of natural numbers will be denoted by N, and \"0\" will be used to denote the natural number which is not the successor of any other natural number.\n\nRepeated addition of natural numbers is generalized as multiplication of natural numbers\n\n== Notation and terms ==\n\nThe operation of addition, commonly written as the infix operator \"+\", is a function +: N &times; N → N. For natural numbers a, b, and c, we write\n\n:<math>a + b = c</math>\n\nHere, a is the augend, b is the addend, and c is the sum.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nAssume that <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>, the set of Natural Numbers, has been defined by the Peano postulates as follows:\n\n* <math>0 \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>* <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rarr S(n) \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>\n\nWhere <math>S(a)</math> is the successor of a defined as \n\n* <math>S : \\mathbb{N} \\rarr \\mathbb{N}</math>\n\nAddition is defined inductively by fixing the augend. In other words, we let a be any arbitrary, but fixed natural number, and we then make the following definitions A1 and A2:\n\n* <math>a + 0 = a</math> [A1]* <math>a + S(b) = S(a + b)</math> [A2]\n\nIn words, this says that adding zero, which is the additive-identity, to a gives back a, and that applying the successor function to the addend has the effect of applying the successor function to the sum.\n\nBy the recursion theorem, this defines a unique function <math>+ : \\mathbb{N} \\rarr \\mathbb{N}</math>, in other words a unique function \"+\" that maps <math>\\mathbb{N}</math> back onto <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThe following are three immediate and important properties of addition which can be deduced from the definition.\n\n: Let <math>a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{N}</math>\n\n* Associativity::<math>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c);\\,</math> * Commutativity: :<math>a + b = b + a;\\,</math> * Identity element: :<math>a + 0 = 0 + a = a.\\,</math> :where 0 is known as the additive identity under <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>. Strictly it is defined as a right identity, but by commutativity, is becomes the general identity in the group <math>(\\mathbb{N}, +)</math>\n\nTogether, these three properties show that the set of natural numbers <math>\\mathbb{N}</math> under addition is a commutative monoid.\n\nCategory:Elementary arithmetic\n\nfr:Addition dans l'arithmétique de Peanoja:加法","category":"Elementary_arithmetic"},{"page_id":2526,"parsed_text":"rightthumb{{commonscat|Agostino Carracci}}Agostino Carracci (or Caracci) (August 16, 1557 – March 22, 1602) was an Italian painter and printmaker.

It passes through the plasma membrane twelve times. \n\nThe important parts for its function are located in the cytoplasm and can be subdivided into the N-terminus, C1a, C1b, C2a, and C2b. \n\nThe C1 region exists between transmembrane helices six and seven, and the C2 region follows transmembrane helix 12. \n\nThe C1a and C2a domains form a catalytic dimer where ATP binds and is converted to cAMP.\n\n==Regulation==\nAdenylate cyclase is dually regulated by G proteins (Gs stimulating activity and Gi inhibiting it), and by forskolin, as well as other class-specific substrates:* Isoforms I, III and VIII are also stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin.* Isoforms V and VI are inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a calmodulin-independent manner. * Isoforms II, IV and IX are stimulated by beta gamma subunits of the G protein.* Isoforms I, V and VI are most clearly inhibited by Gi, while other isoforms show less dual regulation by the inhibitory G protein.* Soluble AC (sAC) is not a transmembrane form and is not regulated by G proteins or forskolin, instead acts as a bicarbonate/pH sensor.\n\nIn neurons, calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases are located next to calcium ion channels for faster reaction to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; they are suspected of playing an important role in learning processes. This is supported by the fact that adenylate cyclases are coincidence detectors, meaning that they are activated only by several different signals occurring together. In peripheral cells and tissues adenylate cyclases appear to form molecular complexes with specific receptors and other signaling proteins in an isoform-specific manner.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery> Image:BARK10161982.JPG|Beta adrenergic receptor kinase pathway</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* {{MeshName|Adenylate+cyclase}}\n\n{{Phosphorus-oxygen lyases}}Category:EC 4.6.1Category:Cell signalingCategory:Signal transduction\n\nca:Adenilat ciclasacs:Adenylátcyklázade:Adenylylcyclasenes:Adenilil ciclasafr:Adénylate cyclaseit:Adenilato ciclasija:アデニル酸シクラーゼpl:Cyklaza adenylowapt:Adenilato ciclaseru:Аденилатциклазаfi:Adenylaattisyklaasi","category":"Cell_signaling"},{"page_id":2528,"parsed_text":"{{Unreferenced|date=November 2007}}{{enzyme| Name = Adenylate cyclase| EC_number = 4.6.1.1| CAS_number = 9012-42-4| IUBMB_EC_number = 4/6/1/1| GO_code = 0008294| image = G protein signal transduction (epinephrin pathway).png| width = | caption = Epinephrine binds its receptor, that associates with an heterotrimeric G protein.

It passes through the plasma membrane twelve times. \n\nThe important parts for its function are located in the cytoplasm and can be subdivided into the N-terminus, C1a, C1b, C2a, and C2b. \n\nThe C1 region exists between transmembrane helices six and seven, and the C2 region follows transmembrane helix 12. \n\nThe C1a and C2a domains form a catalytic dimer where ATP binds and is converted to cAMP.\n\n==Regulation==\nAdenylate cyclase is dually regulated by G proteins (Gs stimulating activity and Gi inhibiting it), and by forskolin, as well as other class-specific substrates:* Isoforms I, III and VIII are also stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin.* Isoforms V and VI are inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a calmodulin-independent manner. * Isoforms II, IV and IX are stimulated by beta gamma subunits of the G protein.* Isoforms I, V and VI are most clearly inhibited by Gi, while other isoforms show less dual regulation by the inhibitory G protein.* Soluble AC (sAC) is not a transmembrane form and is not regulated by G proteins or forskolin, instead acts as a bicarbonate/pH sensor.\n\nIn neurons, calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases are located next to calcium ion channels for faster reaction to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; they are suspected of playing an important role in learning processes. This is supported by the fact that adenylate cyclases are coincidence detectors, meaning that they are activated only by several different signals occurring together. In peripheral cells and tissues adenylate cyclases appear to form molecular complexes with specific receptors and other signaling proteins in an isoform-specific manner.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery> Image:BARK10161982.JPG|Beta adrenergic receptor kinase pathway</gallery>\n\n==External links==\n* {{MeshName|Adenylate+cyclase}}\n\n{{Phosphorus-oxygen lyases}}Category:EC 4.6.1Category:Cell signalingCategory:Signal transduction\n\nca:Adenilat ciclasacs:Adenylátcyklázade:Adenylylcyclasenes:Adenilil ciclasafr:Adénylate cyclaseit:Adenilato ciclasija:アデニル酸シクラーゼpl:Cyklaza adenylowapt:Adenilato ciclaseru:Аденилатциклазаfi:Adenylaattisyklaasi","category":"Signal_transduction"},{"page_id":2536,"parsed_text":"{{Infobox musical artist | Name = Articolo 31| Img =| Img_capt =| Img_size = | Landscape = | Background = group_or_band| Alias = | Origin = Milan, Italy| Genre = Old school rap<br/>Hip hop<br/>Alternative rap<br/>Rap rock| Years_active = 1990-2006| Label = Ricordi (1990-1998), BMG (1998-2003)| Associated_acts = | URL = [http://www.articolo31.com Articolo 31 official webpage]| Current_members = J Ax, DJ Jad| Past_members = }}\n\nArticolo 31 is a popular band in Milan, Italy, melding hip hop, funk, pop and traditional Italian musical forms.

Aidouoi - Αἴδουοι), were a Gallic people of Gallia Lugdunensis, who inhabited the country between the Arar (Saône) and Liger (Loire), in today's France.\n\nThe statement in Strabo (ii. 3. 192) that they dwelt between the Arar and Dubis (Doubs) is incorrect{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of Saône-et-Loire, Côte-d'Or and Nièvre. According to Livy (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of Bellovesus into Italy in the 6th century BC.\n\nBefore Caesar's time they had attached themselves to the Romans, and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. When the Sequani, their neighbours on the other side of the Arar, with whom they were continually quarrelling, invaded their country and subjugated them with the assistance of a Germanic chieftain named Ariovistus, the Aedui sent Diviciacus, the druid, to Rome to appeal to the senate for help, but his mission was unsuccessful{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.\n\nOn his arrival in Gaul (58 BC), Caesar restored their independence. In spite of this, the Aedui joined the Gallic coalition against Caesar (B. G. vii. 42), but after the surrender of Vercingetorix at Alesia were glad to return to their allegiance. Augustus dismantled{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} their native capital Bibracte on Mont Beuvray, and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name, Augustodunum (modern Autun).\n\nIn 21, during the reign of Tiberius, they revolted under Julius Sacrovir, and seized Augustodunum, but were soon put down by Gaius Silius (Tacitus Ann. iii. 43-46). The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor Claudius the distinction of jus honorum. The oration of Eumenius, in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected. The chief magistrate of the Aedui in Caesar's time was called Vergobretus (according to Mommsen, \"judgment-worker\"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier.

For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.\n\nA general devise, is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.\n\nA residual devise is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made.

Opioids have agonist actions on the intestinal opioid receptors, which when activated cause constipation. Drugs such as morphine or codeine can be used to relieve diarrhea this way. A notable opioid for the purpose of relief of diarrhea is Loperamide which only is an agonist of the μ opioid receptors in the large intestine and does not have opioid affects in the central nervous system as it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier in significant amounts. This enables loperamide to be used to the same benefit as other opioid drugs but without the CNS side effects or potential for abuse.\n\n==See also==\n* ATC_code_A07#A07F_Antidiarrheal_micro-organisms\n\n{{Major Drug Groups}}{{Antidiarrheals, intestinal anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents}}\n\n*\n\nca:Antidiarreicfr:Antidiarrhéiquehr:Antidijaroiciid:Antidiareja:止瀉薬th:ยาแก้ท้องร่วง","category":"Antidiarrhoeals"},{"page_id":2691,"parsed_text":"{{Infobox royalty| name = Áed| succession = King of the Picts| reign = 877&ndash;878| predecessor = Constantín mac Cináeda| successor = Giric| issue = Constantine II, King of Alba| house = Alpin| father = Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Picts| date of birth = before 858| date of death = 878| place of death = Strathallan| place of burial = Iona}}Áed mac Cináeda (died 878) was a son of Cináed mac Ailpín (\"Kenneth MacAlpin\").

J. P. de Florian's Gonsalve de Cordoue and Châteaubriand's Le dernier des Abencerrages are imitations of Perez de Hita's work.\n\nThe story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the Alhambra, and ordered the Zergis to kill them all. The apartment where this is to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages. \n\nMany poems and plays, and one opera (Les Abencérages, by Luigi Cherubini) mention the legend, but the whole story is doubtful, because the best historians do not mention it.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/i/irving/washington/i72a/part17.html The Abencerrages]–Part 17 of Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra\n\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Abencerrages}}{{1911}}\n\nCategory:Nasrid dynasty\n\nca:Abenserraigsde:Abencerragenes:Abencerrajesfr:Abencéragespl:Abencerrajespt:Abencerragensru:Абенсерагиsv:Abenserragerna","category":"Nasrid_dynasty"}]
