In the game of poker  a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round  Normally this occurs when a player calls  and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise  so he can not raise further  this ends the betting round   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act  but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a subminimum allin
In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives  For a bet for value to b

In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then

In the game of poker  a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round  Normally this occurs when a player calls  and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise  so he can not raise further  this ends the betting round   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act  but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a subminimum allin
In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives  For a bet for value to b

In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then

In the game of poker  a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round  Normally this occurs when a player calls  and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise  so he can not raise further  this ends the betting round   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act  but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a subminimum allin
In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives  For a bet for value to b
Protection in poker is a bet made with a strong but vulnerable hand  such as top pair when straight or flush draws are possible  The bet forces opponents with draws to either call with insufficient pot odds  or to fold  both of which are profitable for the betting player  By contrast  if he failed to protect his hand  another player could draw out on him at no cost  meaning he gets no value from his made handA protection play differs from a bluff in that the bluff can win only when the opponent

In poker  a made hand is one that does not need improvement to win  in contrast to a drawing hand  For example in Draw poker  if you have two pairs  and your opponent is drawing for a straight or flush  you are said to have a made hand because even though you will be drawing a card just as he will  you can win even if you do nt draw a card that improves your hand  while he can not win unless he improves 
In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then

300pxThe blinds are forced bets posted by players to the left of the dealer button in flopstyle poker games  The number of blinds is usually two  but can be one or threeThe small blind is placed by the player to the left of the dealer button and the big blind is then posted by the player to the left of the person sitting in the small blind  The one exception to this rule is when there are only 2 players  a  headsup  game   In this case the player on the button is the small blind  and the othe
In poker  the showdown is when  if more than one player remains after the last betting round  remaining players expose and compare their hands to determine the winner or winners  To win any part of a pot if more than one player has a hand  a player must show all of his cards faceup on the table  whether they were used in the final hand played or not  Cards speak for themselves  the actual value of a player s hand prevails in the event a player misstates the value of his hand  Because exposing a
A checkraise in poker is a common deceptive play in which a player checks early in a betting round  hoping someone else will open  The player who checked then raises in the same roundThis might be done  for example  when the first player believes that an opponent has an inferior hand and will not call a direct bet  but that he may attempt to bluff  allowing the first player to win more money than he would by betting straightforwardly  The key point is that if no one else is keen to bet  then t

One player to a hand is an important poker rule designed to promote fair play that is universally applied in casino play  It states that all game decisions about the play of each hand must be made by one player without assistance  This means  for example  that a player may not ask for advice from any other player or nonplayer during the play of the hand  nor should anyone offer such advice  The phrase is often used as a warning to players making what might be perceived as minor violations  such
Cards speak   for themselves   is used in two poker contexts  First  it is used to describe a highlow split game without a declaration  That is  in a cards speak game  players all reveal their hands at the showdown  and whoever has the highest hand wins the high half of the pot and whoever has the lowest hand wins the low halfThe other context is as a house rule in casino cardrooms   Cards speak  means that any verbal declaration as to the content of a player  s hand is not binding  If Mary says
There are several actions in poker called declaration  in which a player formally expresses his intent to take some action  which he may perform at a later point  For example  one may verbally declare an action  fold  call  raise  while in turn  which obligates the player to complete that actionOne may declare a number of cards to draw in a draw poker game  which is typically not binding   or one may declare some other choice specific to the variant being playedBut most commonly  the term refe
In the game of poker  a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round  Normally this occurs when a player calls  and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise  so he can not raise further  this ends the betting round   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act  but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a subminimum allin
In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives  For a bet for value to b
Protection in poker is a bet made with a strong but vulnerable hand  such as top pair when straight or flush draws are possible  The bet forces opponents with draws to either call with insufficient pot odds  or to fold  both of which are profitable for the betting player  By contrast  if he failed to protect his hand  another player could draw out on him at no cost  meaning he gets no value from his made handA protection play differs from a bluff in that the bluff can win only when the opponent

In poker  a made hand is one that does not need improvement to win  in contrast to a drawing hand  For example in Draw poker  if you have two pairs  and your opponent is drawing for a straight or flush  you are said to have a made hand because even though you will be drawing a card just as he will  you can win even if you do nt draw a card that improves your hand  while he can not win unless he improves 
In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then
Position in poker refers to the order in which players are seated around the table and the related poker strategy implications  Players who act first are in  early position   players who act later are in  late position   A player  has position  on opponents acting before him and is  out of position  to opponents acting after him  Because players act in clockwise order  a player  has position  on opponents seated to his right  except when the opponent has the button and certain cases in the first

In poker  certain aggression plays like steals can be very effective  players must occasionally reply to them with defensive plays with hands they might not otherwise play  If  for example  an opponent to a player s right frequently steals when the player has posted a blind  the player can be reasonably sure that the opponent is often doing so with inferior hands  otherwise he would nt be doing it so often   the player can likely defend his blind  call or raise back  with more hands than he migh

In poker  dead money is the amount of money in the pot other than the equal amounts bet by active remaining players in that pot  Examples of dead money include money contributed to the pot by players who have folded  a dead blind posted by a player returning to a game after missing blinds  or an odd chip left in the pot from a previous deal  For example  eight players each ante  1  one player opens for  2  and gets two callers  making the pot total  14  Three players are now in the pot having co
In poker  an isolation play is usually a raise designed to encourage one or more players to fold  specifically for the purpose of making the hand a oneonone contest with a specific opponent  For example  if an opponent raises and a player suspects he is bluffing  a player may reraise to pressure other opponents to fold  with the aim of getting heads upIsolation plays are most common against overlyaggressive players   maniacs   who frequently play inferior hands  or with players who may have

In poker  the starting hand is the initial set of cards dealt to each player before any voluntary betting takes place  For example  in sevencard stud this is two downcards and one upcard  in Texas hold em it is two downcards  in fivecard draw it is five cardsThe one decision made by every poker player on every deal of every game is whether to continue playing that hand after seeing that first set of cards  Since making this decision correctly will lead to the most longrun profit for a skill
In the game of poker  opens and raises are considered aggressive plays  while calls and checks are considered passive  though a checkraise would be considered a very aggressive play   It is said that  aggression has its own value   meaning that often aggressive plays can make money with weak hands because of bluff value  In general  opponents must respond to aggressive play by playing more loosely  which offers more opportunities to make mistakesWhile it is true that aggressive play is general
After a deck of cards is shuffled by the dealer  it is often given to a player other than the one who performed the shuffle for a procedure called a cut Procedure The dealer completes their shuffle  and then sets the cards facedown on the table near the designated player  typically the player to the dealer s right  The player cuts the deck by removing a contiguous range of cards from the deck  and places them toward himself so that the stack of cards to be dealt is closest to the dealer  T

One player to a hand is an important poker rule designed to promote fair play that is universally applied in casino play  It states that all game decisions about the play of each hand must be made by one player without assistance  This means  for example  that a player may not ask for advice from any other player or nonplayer during the play of the hand  nor should anyone offer such advice  The phrase is often used as a warning to players making what might be perceived as minor violations  such
Cards speak   for themselves   is used in two poker contexts  First  it is used to describe a highlow split game without a declaration  That is  in a cards speak game  players all reveal their hands at the showdown  and whoever has the highest hand wins the high half of the pot and whoever has the lowest hand wins the low halfThe other context is as a house rule in casino cardrooms   Cards speak  means that any verbal declaration as to the content of a player  s hand is not binding  If Mary says
There are several actions in poker called declaration  in which a player formally expresses his intent to take some action  which he may perform at a later point  For example  one may verbally declare an action  fold  call  raise  while in turn  which obligates the player to complete that actionOne may declare a number of cards to draw in a draw poker game  which is typically not binding   or one may declare some other choice specific to the variant being playedBut most commonly  the term refe
In the game of poker  a betting round is said to be closed if no player will have the right to raise in the round  Normally this occurs when a player calls  and the next player whose turn it is to act is the one who made the last raise  so he can not raise further  this ends the betting round   The round can also said to be closed before it has actually ended if there are still players remaining to act  but they will not be entitled to raise either because the last raise was a subminimum allin
In poker  the strength of a hand  how likely it is to be the best according to the rules of the game being played  is often called its value  however  in the context of poker strategy the term is more often used to describe a betting tactic  a bet for value  This bet  or raise  is intended to increase the size of the pot  by inducing opponents to call  A bet for value is in contrast to a bluff or a protection bet  though some bets may have a combination of these motives  For a bet for value to b
Protection in poker is a bet made with a strong but vulnerable hand  such as top pair when straight or flush draws are possible  The bet forces opponents with draws to either call with insufficient pot odds  or to fold  both of which are profitable for the betting player  By contrast  if he failed to protect his hand  another player could draw out on him at no cost  meaning he gets no value from his made handA protection play differs from a bluff in that the bluff can win only when the opponent

In poker  a made hand is one that does not need improvement to win  in contrast to a drawing hand  For example in Draw poker  if you have two pairs  and your opponent is drawing for a straight or flush  you are said to have a made hand because even though you will be drawing a card just as he will  you can win even if you do nt draw a card that improves your hand  while he can not win unless he improves 
In a poker game with more than one betting round  an out is any unseen card that  if drawn  will improve a player s hand to one that is likely to win  Knowing the number of outs a player has is an important part of poker strategy  For example in draw poker  a hand with four diamonds has nine outs to make a flush  there are 13 diamonds in the deck  and four of them have been seen  If a player has two small pairs  and he believes that it will be necessary for him to make a full house to win  then
Position in poker refers to the order in which players are seated around the table and the related poker strategy implications  Players who act first are in  early position   players who act later are in  late position   A player  has position  on opponents acting before him and is  out of position  to opponents acting after him  Because players act in clockwise order  a player  has position  on opponents seated to his right  except when the opponent has the button and certain cases in the first

In poker  a steal is a type of a bluff  a raise during the first betting round made with an inferior hand and meant to make other players fold superior hands because of shown strength  A steal is normally either an  ante steal  or  blind steal   depending on whether the game being played uses antes or blinds  Steals are done with hands less valuable than what might normally be considered a raising hand  normally a below average one  with the hope that the few players remaining will not have a ha

In poker  certain aggression plays like steals can be very effective  players must occasionally reply to them with defensive plays with hands they might not otherwise play  If  for example  an opponent to a player s right frequently steals when the player has posted a blind  the player can be reasonably sure that the opponent is often doing so with inferior hands  otherwise he would nt be doing it so often   the player can likely defend his blind  call or raise back  with more hands than he migh

In poker  dead money is the amount of money in the pot other than the equal amounts bet by active remaining players in that pot  Examples of dead money include money contributed to the pot by players who have folded  a dead blind posted by a player returning to a game after missing blinds  or an odd chip left in the pot from a previous deal  For example  eight players each ante  1  one player opens for  2  and gets two callers  making the pot total  14  Three players are now in the pot having co
In poker  an isolation play is usually a raise designed to encourage one or more players to fold  specifically for the purpose of making the hand a oneonone contest with a specific opponent  For example  if an opponent raises and a player suspects he is bluffing  a player may reraise to pressure other opponents to fold  with the aim of getting heads upIsolation plays are most common against overlyaggressive players   maniacs   who frequently play inferior hands  or with players who may have

In poker  a freeroll has two distinct meanings  One applies to the play of a single hand  and the other describes an entire poker tournamentFreeroll handIn playing a particular hand of poker  a freeroll is a situation that arises  usually when only two players remain  before the last card has been dealt  in which one player is guaranteed to at least split the pot with his opponent no matter what the final cards are  but where there is some chance he can win the whole pot if certain final ca
In poker  the starting hand is the initial set of cards dealt to each player before any voluntary betting takes place  For example  in sevencard stud this is two downcards and one upcard  in Texas hold em it is two downcards  in fivecard draw it is five cardsThe one decision made by every poker player on every deal of every game is whether to continue playing that hand after seeing that first set of cards  Since making this decision correctly will lead to the most longrun profit for a skill
In the game of poker  opens and raises are considered aggressive plays  while calls and checks are considered passive  though a checkraise would be considered a very aggressive play   It is said that  aggression has its own value   meaning that often aggressive plays can make money with weak hands because of bluff value  In general  opponents must respond to aggressive play by playing more loosely  which offers more opportunities to make mistakesWhile it is true that aggressive play is general
After a deck of cards is shuffled by the dealer  it is often given to a player other than the one who performed the shuffle for a procedure called a cut Procedure The dealer completes their shuffle  and then sets the cards facedown on the table near the designated player  typically the player to the dealer s right  The player cuts the deck by removing a contiguous range of cards from the deck  and places them toward himself so that the stack of cards to be dealt is closest to the dealer  T
