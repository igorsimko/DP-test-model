It is the only living species of all Tubulidentata, but there are known other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata.\n\nIt is sometimes called \"antbear\", \"anteater\", \"Cape anteater\" (after the Cape of Good Hope), \"earth hog\" or \"earth pig\". The word \"aardvark\" is famous for being one of the first entries to appear in many encyclopaedias and even abridged dictionaries. The name comes from the Afrikaans/Dutch for \"earth pig\" or \"ground pig\" (aarde earth/ground, varken pig), because early settlers from Europe thought it resembled a domesticated pig. However, the aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole recent representative of the obscure mammalian order Tubulidentata, in which it is usually considered to form a single variable species of the genus Orycteropus, coextensive with the family Orycteropodidae. The aardvark is not closely related to the South American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, along with the sirenians, hyraxes, tenrecs, and elephants. Together, these animals form the superorder Afrotheria.\n\n==Description==\nleftOne of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is (as the name implies) their teeth. Instead of having a pulp cavity, each tooth has a cluster of thin, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of dentine), with individual pulp canals, held together by cementum. The teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks only have cheek teeth at the back of the jaw, and have a dental formula of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}}\n\nGenetically speaking, the aardvark is a living fossil, as its chromosomes are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa.\n\nThe aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with an arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb') â resulting in four toes â but the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof. The ears are disproportionately long, and the tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers. The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on termites. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell.\n\nAn aardvark's weight is typically between 40 and 65&nbsp;kg. An aardvark's length is usually between 1 and 1.3 metres, and can reach lengths of 2.2 metres when its tail (which can be up to 70 centimetres) is taken into account. The aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by soil. The aardvark's coat is thin and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest, which also serves as protection from its predators.\n\n==Behavior==\nthumbThe aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites (formicivore); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30 kilometers, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long, sticky tongue&mdash;as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. It is an exceptionally fast digger, but otherwise moves fairly slowly. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly, avoiding the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (as long as 30 centimeters) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. Its keen hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, hyenas, and pythons.\n\nAside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live: temporary sites are scattered around the home range as refuges, and a main burrow is used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 meters. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and from time to time moves on and makes a new one; the old burrows are then inhabited by smaller animals like the African Wild Dog. Only mothers and young share burrows. If attacked in the tunnel, it will seal the tunnel off behind itself or turn around and attack with its claws.\n\nthumbAardvarks only pair during the breeding season; after a gestation period of 7 months, a single cub weighing around 2&nbsp;kg is born, and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks, and is eating termites at 14 weeks and is weaned by 16 weeks. At six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season, and is sexually capable by the season after that.\n\nAardvarks can live to be over 24 years old in captivity.\n\nThe aardvark's main predators are lions, leopards, hunting dogs and pythons. Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs to lash with all fours. Their thick skin also protects them to some extent.\n\n==Habitat==\nAardvarks live in subsaharan Africa, where there is suitable habitat for them to live, such as savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bushland, and available food (i.e., ants and termites).\n\n==Mythology and popular culture==\nIn African folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants. Hausa magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.\n\nThe main character of Arthur, a popular animated television series for children produced by WGBH-TV and shown in more than 100 countries, is an aardvark.\n\nOne of the main characters of The Ant and the Aardvark, is a blue aardvark, voiced by John Byner, doing an impersonation of Jackie Mason. It depicts the Aardvark attempting, and failing, to catch and eat his antagonist, the Ant. \n\nCerebus the Aardvark was the title character of a comic-book series by Dave Sim and Gerhard that ran from 1977 to 2004, and is still sold in collected volumes of reprints.\n\nDuring character development for what would eventually be Spiderman, Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originally wanted a mammalian themed superhero to add to the Marvel Universe. Preliminary ideas led to the creation of \"Aardvarkman,\" a superhero with the ability to control hordes of soldier ants. However, in the words of Ditko \"the idea of a long gross tongue seemed downright evil in nature; a tongue that long with a mouth that small seems ridiculous.\" The soldier ant theme eventually led to the creation of Spider-Man, and the supervillain Toad was eventually created from the failed artwork for Aardvarkman \n\n==See also==\n{{Wikispecies|Orycteropus afer|Aardvark}}{{Commons|Aardvark}}{{Wiktionary|aardvark}}* Aardvark, at wikisource in the The New Student's Reference Work\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}* {{Wikisource1911Enc Citation |Aard-vark}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://research.calacademy.org/research/bmammals/afrotheria/Tubulidentata.html Aardvark.] California Academy of Sciences â Research.* [http://www.wackywildlifewonders.com/files/animals/antbear.html Aardvark â Quick facts and summary.] Wild life wonders from southern Africa.* [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Orycteropus_afer.html ADW: Orycteropus afer: Information.] Animal Diversity Web: University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.* \"The Biology of the Aardvark\" (Orycteropus afer) diploma thesis (without pictures)* [http://www.tierseiten.com/roehrenzaehner/aardvark.pdf \"The Biology of the Aardvark\" (Orycteropus afer)] same diploma thesis (including the pictures)* [http://www.zooborns.typepad.com/zooborns/aardvark/ Some good photos of baby aardvarks]\n\n{{mammals}}\n\nCategory:Mammals of AfricaCategory:Myrmecophagous mammalsCategory:Words of Afrikaans originCategory:Living fossilsCategory:Megafauna of AfricaCategory:Monotypic mammals\n\naf:Erdvarkar:Ø®ÙØ²ÙØ± Ø§ÙØ£Ø±Ø¶az:BorudiÅlilÉrbn:à¦à¦°à§à¦¡à¦­à¦¾à¦°à§à¦bar:ErdfÃ ggibr:Hoc'h-douarca:Porc formiguercs:HrabÃ¡Äda:Jordsvinde:Erdferkelnv:BisÃ³odi bichÄ¯ÌÄ¯Ìh nineezÃ­et:Tuhnikel:ÎÏÏÎºÏÎµÏÏÏÎ¿ÏÏes:Orycteropus afereo:Orikteropofr:OryctÃ©rope du Capga:ArcÃ¡n talÃºngd:Aardvarkko:ëë¼ì§io:Orikteropois:JarÃ°svÃ­nit:Orycteropus aferhe:×©× ×××sw:Mhangala:Orycteropus aferlij:Tubulidentatali:Eerdverkejbo:rikteropuhu:FÃ¶ldimalacmt:Orikteropunl:Aardvarkenja:ãããã¿no:Jordsvinnrm:Couochon d'tÃ¨rrepl:MrÃ³wnikpt:Aardvarkru:Ð¢ÑÑÐ±ÐºÐ¾Ð·ÑÐ±scn:Orycteropus afersimple:Aardvarksr:Ð¦ÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð·ÑÐ¿ÐºÐµfi:Maasikasv:Jordsvintr:Yerdomuzuuk:Ð¢ÑÑÐ±ÐºÐ¾Ð·ÑÐ±zh:åè±","category":"Mammals_of_Africa"},{"page_id":46916,"parsed_text":"{{About|the carnivorous mammals}}{{Taxobox| name = Otters| image = Fischotter, Lutra Lutra.JPG| image_width = 200px| image_caption = Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra)| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Chordata| classis = Mammalia| ordo = Carnivora| familia = Mustelidae| subfamilia = Lutrinae| subdivision_ranks = Genera| subdivision = Amblonyx<br />Aonyx<br />Enhydra<br />Lontra<br />Lutra<br />Lutrogale<br />Pteronura}}Otters are semi-aquatic (or in one case aquatic) fish-eating mammals. The otter subfamily Lutrinae forms part of the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, polecats, badgers, as well as others. With thirteen species in seven genera, otters have an almost worldwide distribution. They mainly eat aquatic animals, predominantly fish and shellfish, but also other invertebrates, amphibians, birds and small mammals.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This and cognate words in other Indo-European languages ultimately stem from a root which also gave rise to the English words water.\n\nAn otter's den is called a holt or couch. A male otter is a dog (otter), a female a bitch (otter), and a baby a whelp or pup. The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge or romp, being descriptive of their often playful nature, or when in water raft.{{Fact|April 2009|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Characteristics==\nOtters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs, with webbed paws. Most have sharp claws on their feet, and all except the sea otter have long muscular tails.\n\nThey have a very soft, insulated underfur which is protected by their outer layer of long guard hair. This traps a layer of air, and keeps them dry and warm under water.\n\nMany otters live in cold waters and have very high metabolic rates to help keep them warm. Eurasian otters must eat 15% of their body-weight a day, and sea otters 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as 10Â°C (50Â°F) an otter needs to catch 100 grams (3&nbsp;oz) of fish per hour to survive. Most species hunt for 3 to 5 hours a day, and nursing mothers up to 8 hours a day.\n\nFor most otters, fish is the primary staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, crayfish and crabs. Some otters are expert at opening shellfish, and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion.\n\nOtters are very active, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, entering it mainly to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged. The sea otter does live in the sea for most of its life. \n\nOtters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment. Different species vary in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others live in groups &ndash; in a few species these groups may be fairly large.\n\n==Species==\n<div class=\"thumb tright\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0.5em;\"><div style=\"border: none;\"><div class=\"thumbcaption\"><center><small>Cladogram, after Koepfli et al. 2008 and Bininda-Emonds et al. 1999</small></center></div></div></div>\n\nGenus Lutra *Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra)*Hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana)Genus Hydrictis *Spotted-necked otter (Hydrictis maculicollis)Genus Lutrogale *Smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata)Genus Lontra *Northern river otter (Lontra canadensis) *Southern river otter (Lontra provocax) *Neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis) *Marine otter (Lontra felina) Genus Pteronura *Giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis)Genus Aonyx *African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis)*Oriental small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea)Genus Enhydra *Sea otter (Enhydra lutris)\n\nthumb=== Northern river otter ==={{main|Northern river otter}}The northern river otter (Lontra canadensis) became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for fur in North America after European contact. River otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish, as well as small land mammals and birds. They grow to one metre (3 to 4&nbsp;ft) in length and weigh from five to fifteen kilograms (10 to 30&nbsp;lb). \n\nIn some areas this is a protected species, and some places have otter sanctuaries, which help sick and injured otters to recover.\n\nthumb===Sea otter==={{main|Sea otter}}Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) live along the Pacific coast of North America. Their historic range included shallow waters of the Bering Strait and Kamchatka, and as far south as Japan. Sea otters have about 26,000 to 165,000 strands of hair per square centimetre of skin, a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. By the time the 1911 Fur Seal Treaty gave them protection, so few sea otters remained that the fur trade had become unprofitable.Sea otters eat shellfish and other invertebrates (especially clams, abalone, and sea urchins), frequently using rocks as crude tools to smash open shells. They grow to 1.0 to 1.5 metres (2.5 to 5&nbsp;ft) in length and weigh 30 kilograms (65&nbsp;lb). Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in California and Alaska.\n\nUnlike most marine mammals (such as seals or whales), sea otters do not have a layer of insulating blubber. As with other species of otter, they rely on a layer of air trapped in their fur, which they keep topped up by blowing into the fur from their mouths. They spend most of their time in the water, whereas other otters spend much of their time on land.\n\nthumb\n\n=== Eurasian otter ===\n{{main|Eurasian otter}}This species (Lutra lutra) inhabits Europe, and its range also extends across most of Asia and parts of North Africa. In the British Isles they occurred commonly as recently as the 1950s, but became rare in many areas due to the use of chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides and as a result of habitat-loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of Scotland and Ireland). Population levels attained a low point in the 1980s, but are now recovering strongly. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan envisages the re-establishment of otters by 2010 in all the UK rivers and coastal areas that they inhabited in 1960. Roadkill deaths have become one of the significant threats to the success of their re-establishment.\n\nthumb\n\n=== Giant otter ===\n{{main|Giant Otter}}The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) inhabits South America, especially the Amazon river basin, but is becoming increasingly rare due to poaching, habitat loss, and the use of mercury and other toxins in illegal alluvial gold mining. This gregarious animal grows to a length of up to 1.8 metres (6&nbsp;ft), and is more aquatic than most other otters.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n=== Fishing ===\nFor countless generations, fishermen in southern Bangladesh have bred otters and used them to chase fish into their nets. Once a widespread practice passed down from father to son throughout many communities in Asia, this traditional use of domesticated wild animals is still in practice in the district of Narail, Bangladesh.\n\n=== Religion and mythology ===\nNorse mythology tells of the dwarf Ãtr habitually taking the form of an otter. The myth of Otter's Ransom is the starting point of the Volsunga saga.\n\nIn some Native American cultures, otters are considered totem animals.\n\nThe otter is held to be a clean animal belonging to Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrian belief, and taboo to kill.\n\n=== Media ===\nEmmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas is a children's storybook by Russell Hoban that was adapted by Jim Henson and Paul Williams into a musical television special and by The Jim Henson Company into a live musical stage show.\n\nGavin Maxwell's book Ring of Bright Water tells the tale of how he brought a Smooth-coated Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) back from Iraq and raised it in 'Camusfearna' (Sandaig), on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nThe animated Nickelodeon TV show The Penguins of Madagascar features an otter character named Marlene.\n\nIn the book and movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione Granger's Patronus takes the shape of an otter. \n\n==Gallery==\n{{Gallery|title=|width=120|height=150|lines=3|Image:Eurasian_otter.jpg|Eurasian Otter Edinburgh Zoo|Image:Amblonyx_cinereus.jpg|Oriental small-clawed otter|Image:Lontra_longicaudis_05.jpg|Long-tailed otter in Costa Rica|Image:OtterinHolt.JPG|Eurasian otter in holt|Image:Otters.jpg|Otters at the Perth Zoo|Image:Pair of Otters.jpg|Pair of otters}}\n\n== See also ==\n* Pantolestidae, an extinct otter-like mammal (60-40 mya)\n\n==References and further reading==\n{{wikispecies|lutrinae}}{{commonscat|Lutrinae}}{{Wiktionary}}{{Wikisource1911Enc|otter}}{{reflist}}{{refbegin}}*Gallant, D., L.

The name troglodytes, Greek for 'cave-dweller', was coined by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in his Handbuch der Naturgeschichte (Handbook of Natural History) published in 1779. Colloquially, it is often called the chimpanzee (or simply 'chimp'), though technically this term refers to both species in the genus Pan: the Common Chimpanzee and the closely-related Bonobo, or Pygmy Chimpanzee. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing show that the Chimpanzee is the closest living relative to modern human beings.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nRecent DNA evidence suggests the Bonobo and Common Chimpanzee species separated from each other less than one million years ago (similar in relation between Homo sapiens and Neanderthals). The chimpanzee line split from the last common ancestor of the human line approximately six million years ago. Because no species other than Homo sapiens has survived from the human line of that branching, both chimpanzee species are the closest living relatives of humans. The chimpanzee's genus, Pan, diverged from the Gorilla's genus about 7 million years ago.\n\n===Subspecies===\nSeveral subspecies of the Common Chimpanzee have been recognized:* Central Chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo;* Western Chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes verus, in Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria;* Nigeria-Cameroon Chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes vellerosus, in Nigeria and Cameroon;* Eastern Chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in the Central African Republic, the Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Zambia.\n\n===Chimpanzee Genome Project===\n{{Main|Chimpanzee Genome Project}}thumbHuman and Common Chimpanzee DNA are very similar. After the completion of the Human genome project, a Common Chimpanzee Genome Project was initiated. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes, such as the forkhead-box P2 transcription factor which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on September 1, 2005, in an article produced by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium. {{cite journal |author=Cheng Z, Ventura M, She X, et al. |title=A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=88â93 |year=2005 |month=September |pmid=16136132 |doi=10.1038/nature04000 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04000.html}}</ref> The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees is about thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. Typical human and chimp protein homologs differ in only an average of two amino acids. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of chromosomes have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions, during the approximately four to six million years since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor. Results from human and chimp genome analyses, currently being conducted by geneticists including David Reich, should help in understanding the genetic basis of some human diseases. \n\n==Description==\nAdults in the wild weigh between {{convert|40|and|65|kg|abbr=on}}; males can measure up to {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=on}} and females to {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}}. Its body is covered by a coarse black hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Both its thumbs and its big toes are opposable, allowing a precision grip. Its gestation period is eight months. Infants are weaned when they are about three years old, but usually maintain a close relationship with their mother for several more years; they reach puberty at the age of eight to ten, and their lifespan in captivity is about fifty years.\n\n==Ecology==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}Common Chimpanzees are found in the tropical forests and wet savannas of Western and Central Africa. They once inhabited most of this region, but their habitat has been dramatically reduced in recent years.\n\n===Diet===\nthumbAlthough omnivorous, its diet is mainly vegetarian (but eats meat whenever it is available) consisting of fruits, leaves, nuts, seeds, tubers, and other miscellaneous vegetation. Termites are also eaten regularly in some populations. Western Red Colobus Monkeys (Piliocolobus badius) are hunted if available. In some cases, they have been documented to kill Leopard cubs, though this primarily seems to be a protective effort, since the Leopard is the main natural predator of the Common Chimpanzee. Isolated cases of cannibalism have also been documented.\n\nThe West African Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is the only animal besides humans known to routinely create and use specialized tools specifically for hunting. Chimpanzees near KÃ©dougou, Senegal were observed to create spears by breaking off tree limbs, stripping them of their bark, and sharpening one end with their teeth. They then used these weapons to kill galagos sleeping in hollows.\n\n==Behavior==\nCommon Chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from twenty to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time travelling in small parties of just a few individuals. They are both arboreal and terrestrial, spending equal time in the trees and on the ground. Their habitual gait is quadrupedal, using the soles of their feet and resting on their knuckles, but they can walk upright for short distances. Common Chimpanzees are 'knuckle walkers', like gorillas, in contrast to the quadrupedal locomotion of orangutans and bonobos, 'palm walkers' who use the outside edge of their palms.\n\nThe Common Chimpanzee lives in a fission-fusion society, where mating is promiscuous, and may be found in groups of the following types: all-male, adult females and offspring, consisting of both sexes, one female and her offspring, or a single individual. At the core of social structures are males, who roam around, protect group members, and search for food. Among males, there is generally a dominance hierarchy. However, this unusual fission-fusion social structure, \"in which portions of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest,\" is highly variable in terms of which particular individual chimpanzees congregate at a given time. This is mainly due to chimpanzees having a high level of individual autonomy within their fission-fusion social groups. Also, communities have large ranges that overlap with those of other groups.thumbAs a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups (as opposed to the much larger parent group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees who regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area.) As stated, these smaller groups also emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized in order to hunt for meat, while a group consisting of one mature male and one mature female may occur for the purposes of copulation. An individual may encounter certain individuals quite frequently, but have run-ins with others almost never or only in large-scale gatherings. Due to the varying frequency at which chimpanzees associate, the structure of their societies is highly complicated.\n\nChimps are highly territorial and are known to kill other chimps. Groups of male chimps patrol the borders of their territory and will brutally attack any foreign chimp that trespasses. Of course patrol parties from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbors. Patrol parties from large groups will even take over a smaller group's territory, gaining access to more resources, food and females.\n\nWhen confronted by a predator, chimpanzees will react with loud screams and use any object they can get against the threat. As noted above, the leopard is the chimp's main natural predator, but they have fallen prey to lions as well. \n\n===Tool use===\nWhile it has long been known that modern chimpanzees use tools, recent research indicates that chimpanzee stone tool use dates to at least 4300 years ago. A recent study revealed the use of such advanced tools as spears, which West African Chimpanzees in Senegal sharpen with their teeth, being used to spear Senegal Bushbabies out of small holes in trees. An Eastern Chimpanzee has been observed using a modified branch as a tool to capture a squirrel. A Common Chimpanzee from the Kasakela chimpanzee community was the first non-human animal observed making a tool, by modifying a twig to use as an instrument for extracting termites from their mound.\n\n==Interactions with humans==\n===Attacks on humans===\nCommon Chimpanzees have been known to attack humans on occasion. There have been many attacks in Uganda by chimpanzees against human children; the results are sometimes fatal for the children. Some of these attacks are presumed to be due to chimpanzees being intoxicated (from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operations) and mistaking human children for the Western Red Colobus, one of their favourite meals. The dangers of careless human interactions with chimpanzees are only aggravated by the fact that many chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals. With up to twice the upper body strength of a human, an angered chimpanzee could easily overpower and potentially kill a fully grown man, as shown by the attack on and near death of former NASCAR driver St. James Davis. Another example of chimpanzee to human aggression occurred February 2009 in Stamford, Connecticut, when a {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}}, 14-year-old pet chimp named Travis attacked his owner's friend, who lost her hands, eyelids, nose and part of her upper jaw/sinus area from the attack. There are at least 6 documented cases of chimpanzees snatching and eating human babies.\n\n===Link with Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1===\nTwo types of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world; HIV-2 is largely confined to west Africa. Both types originated in west and central Africa, jumping from primates to humans. HIV-1 has evolved from a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIVcpz) found in the Common Chimpanzee subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, native to southern Cameroon. Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has the greatest genetic diversity of HIV-1 so far discovered, suggesting that the virus has been there longer than anywhere else. HIV-2 crossed species from a different strain of SIV, found in the Sooty Mangabey, monkeys in Guinea-Bissau.\n\n===Conservation===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n==See also==\n* Great Ape personhood* Jane Goodall* List of non-human apes - list of notable individuals* Theory of mind\n\n==References=={{Reflist|2}}\n\n;General references* Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa, 1775.* Tutin CEG, McGrew WC, Baldwin PJ 1983.

Springbok males weigh between {{convert|33|to|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the females between to {{convert|26|to|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. They can reach running speeds of up to {{convert|80|to|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} , and can leap 3.50 m and can long jump of up to 15 m . \n\nThe Latin name marsupialis derives from a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the middle of the back from the tail onwards. When the male springbok is showing off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, jumping up into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong floral scent of sweat. This ritual is known as pronking from the Afrikaans, meaning to boast or show off.\n\nSpringbok inhabit the dry inland areas of south and southwestern Africa. Their range extends from the northwestern part of South Africa through the Kalahari desert into Namibia and Botswana. Springboks can be found in numbers of up to 250,000 in South Africa. They used to be very common, forming some of the largest herds of mammals ever documented, but their numbers have diminished significantly since the 19th century due to hunting and fences from farms blocking their migratory routes. \n\n== Appearance ==\nSpringbok are between 70 â 87 centimetres tall at the shoulder, depending on the age, weight and gender of the particular antelope, they weigh between 26â40 kg for the females and 33â50 kg for the males. Their colouring consists of three colours, white, reddish/tan and dark brown. Their backs are tan coloured and at the bottom they are white, along each side there is a dark brown stripe extending from the shoulder on towards the inside thigh.\n\nRams are slightly larger than ewes and have thick horns, the ewes tend to have skinnier legs and longer, more frail horns. Average horn length for both genders is 35 cm with the record being a female with horns measuring 49,21 cm in length. Springbok tracks are narrow and sharp and are 5,5 cm from point to point.\n\n== Habitat and diet ==\nIn South Africa springbok inhabit the vast grasslands of the Free State and the open shrublands of the greater and smaller Karoo. In Namibia they live in the grasslands of the south, the Kalahari desert to the east and the dry riverbeds of the northern bushveld of the Windhoek region. In Botswana they mostly live in the Kalahari Desert in the southwestern and central parts of the country.\n\nSpringbok mostly eat grasses, leaves, shoots and other small plants although their favourites include the sweet succulent shrubs of the Karoo.\n\n== Behavior ==\n{{main|Stotting}}Springbok often go into bouts of repeated high leaps (up to 13 feet) into the air in a practice known as \"pronking\" (Afrikaans and Dutch: pronk = to show off) or \"stotting\". While pronking, the Springbok leaps back into the air as soon as it comes down, with its back bowed and the white fan lifted. While the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springboks exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. One theory is that pronking is meant to indicate to predators that they have been spotted. Another is that Springbok show off their individual strength and fitness so that the predator will go for another (presumably weaker) member of the group. Another opinion is that Springboks and other similar antelopes do this to spray a hormone that is secreted from a gland near the heel. \n\nThe Dutch/Afrikaans term Trekbokken refers to the large-scale migration of herds of Springbok that were seen roaming the country during the early pioneering days of South Africa before farming fences were erected. Millions of migrating Springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometers long that could take several days to pass a town. These are the largest herds of mammals ever witnessed.\n\nSpringboks can meet their water needs from the food they eat, and survive without drinking water through dry season, or even over years. Reportedly, in extreme cases, they won't drink water over the their entire life. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when these foods are most succulent\n\n==Relationship with humans==\n=== Conservation ===\nSince prehistory the springbok was hunted by primitive man using stone tools. Up to present times springbok are hunted as game throughout Namibia, Botswana and South Africa because of their beautiful coats, and because they are very common and easy to support on farms with very low rainfall, which means they are cheap to hunt as well. The export of springbok skins mainly from Namibia and South Africa is also a booming industry.\n\nSpringbok populations are one of the few antelope species that are considered to have an expanding population.\n\n=== National symbol ===\nThe springbok was a national symbol of South Africa under white minority rule (including a significant period prior to the establishment of Apartheid). It was adopted as a nickname or mascot by a number of South African sports teams, most famously by the national rugby union team. It appeared on the emblems of the South African Air Force, the logo of South African Airways (for which it remains their radio callsign), the reverse of the Krugerrand, and the Coat of Arms of South Africa. It also featured as the logo of 'South Africa's Own Car', the Ranger, in the early 1970s.\n\nThe former South African Prime Minister and architect of apartheid, Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd, had a dream to change the then-current Flag of South Africa, remove the three small flags in its center (he objected especially to the British Union Flag being there) and replace them with a leaping Springbok Antelope over a wreath of six proteas. This proposal aroused, however, too much controversy and was never implemented. \n\nThe Springbok is currently the national animal of South Africa.\n\nAfter the demise of apartheid, the ANC government decreed that South African sporting teams were to be known as the Proteas after the national flower of South Africa. The rugby union team still maintain the name Springboks, however, after the intervention of then-president Nelson Mandela, who did so as a gesture of goodwill to the mainly white (and largely Afrikaner) rugby supporters. However, the emblem issue occasionally resurfaces, and leads to much controversy.\n\nDuring the Second Boer War, a Boer force attempting to sneak up on the Royal Canadian Dragoons was defeated after their movements startled the nearby springbok, thus alerting the Canadian sentries. This is why the Dragoons have the Springbok as their cap badge and as their mascot.\n\n<gallery>Image:Antidorcas marsupialis angolensis.jpgImage:Gacelas en Etosha.jpgImage:Antidorcas marsupialis (laying).jpgImage:Africa187.jpgImage:Gacelas saltarinas.JPGImage:Etoshapista.jpg</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* Thomson's Gazelle\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons|Antidorcas marsupialis}}{{wikispecies|Antidorcas marsupialis}}{{breakafterimages}}\n\n{{Artiodactyla|R.5}}\n\nCategory:True antelopesCategory:Mammals of AfricaCategory:National symbols of South AfricaCategory:Fauna of South AfricaCategory:Fauna of NamibiaCategory:Fauna of AngolaCategory:Words of Afrikaans origin\n\naf:Springbokbr:Springbokbg:ÐÐ»Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð½ÑÐºÐ¸ ÑÐºÐ°ÐºÐ°Ñca:Gasela saltadoracs:Antilopa skÃ¡kavÃ¡de:Springbockes:Antidorcas marsupialisfr:Springbokit:Antidorcas marsupialishe:××××lt:Å oklioji gazelÄhu:VÃ¡ndorantilopnl:Springbokja:ã¹ããªã³ã°ããã¯no:Springbukkpl:Springbokpt:Cabra-de-lequero:Antidorcas marsupialisru:Ð¡Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð³Ð±Ð¾Ðºsimple:Springboksr:Ð¡Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð½Ð³Ð±Ð¾Ðº Ð°Ð½ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¾Ð¿Ð°fi:Hyppyantilooppisv:Springbocktr:Keseliceylanzh:è·³ç¾","category":"Mammals_of_Africa"},{"page_id":103548,"parsed_text":"{{Citations missing|article|date=June 2009}}{{Taxobox| name = Jerboa | fossil_range = Middle Miocene - Recent| image = Wuestenspringmaus-painting.jpg| image_width = 200px| image_caption = Jaculus jaculus| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Chordata| classis = Mammalia| ordo = Rodentia| superfamilia = Dipodoidea| familia = Dipodidae| familia_authority = Fischer de Waldheim, 1817| subdivision_ranks = Genera| subdivision = 10 genera in 5 subfamilies}}\n\nThe jerboa (from Arabic ÙØ±Ø¨ÙØ¹ yarbÅ«' or Hebrew ××¨×××¢ yarbÅa' ) form the bulk of the membership of the family Dipodidae. Jerboas are hopping desert rodents found throughout Asia and Northern Africa.They tend to be found in hot deserts.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nthumb Jerboas resemble mice with long tufted tails and very long hind legs. The small forelegs are not used for locomotion. In general, Asiatic jerboas have five toes on their hind feet and African jerboas have three; the shapes of their ears vary widely between species {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. Jerboa fur is long, soft and silky. Diet varies considerably: some are specialist seed, insect, or plant eaters, others are omnivores {{Fact|date=June 2009}}.\n\nJerboas have the ability to hop considerable distances relative to its size, an ability that evolved as an adaptation to help them escape from predators, and to assist with long journeys and foraging in its desert environment {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. Although jerboas are not closely related to the hopping mice of Australia or the kangaroo rats of North America, all three groups have evolved a similar set of adaptations to life in the deep desert.\n\n== Burrows and Behavior ==\n\nJerboas are nocturnal. During the heat of the day, they shelter in burrows. They create four separate types of burrow: two temporary, and two permanent {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. The temporary burrows are plain tubes used to escape predators during the night, tending to be just {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=on}} deep, unsealed and not camouflaged {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. Permanent daytime burrows are well-hidden and sealed with a plug of sand to keep heat out and moisture in, and tend to be {{convert|20|to|50|cm|abbr=on}} long {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. A jerboa's permanent burrow often have multiple entrances, and are much more elaborate structures with a nesting chamber {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. The winter burrows have food storage chambers {{convert|40|to|70|cm|abbr=on}} below ground level, and a hibernation chamber an astonishing {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} down.\n\nPerhaps the best-known species is the Lesser Egyptian Jerboa (Jaculus jaculus) which occupies some of the most hostile deserts on the planet. It does not drink at all, relying on its food to provide enough moisture for survival {{Fact|date=June 2009}}. Found in both the sandy and stony deserts of North Africa, Arabia and Iran, this small creature aestivates (analogous to hibernation) during the hottest summer months, and has the ability to leap a full three meters to escape a predator also by jumping in a zig-zag pattern{{Fact|date=June 2009}}.\n\n== Possible Endangerment ==\nTwo species are considered threatened: the Five-toed Pygmy Jerboa (classed 'VU' vulnerable), the Thick-tailed Pygmy Jerboa (classed 'VU' vulnerable). A rare species only recently captured on film in the deserts of Mongolia and China, the Long-eared Jerboa (classed 'LC' least concern ) is no longer believed to be threatened. Many other species have been placed in a \"lower risk\" category, and one species (Thomas's Pygmy Jerboa) lacks the data for assessment.\n\n== Classification ==\nthumb* ORDER RODENTIA* Family Dipodidae** Subfamily Zapodinae: jumping mice, 4 species in 3 genera** Subfamily Sicistinae: birch mice** Subfamily Cardiocraniinae*** Cardiocranius**** Five-toed Pygmy Jerboa, Cardiocranius paradoxus*** Salpingotus**** Thick-tailed Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus crassicauda**** Heptner's Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus heptneri**** Kozlov's Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus kozlovi**** Baluchistan Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus michaelis**** Pallid Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus pallidus**** Thomas's Pygmy Jerboa, Salpingotus thomasi** Subfamily Dipodinae*** Dipus**** Northern Three-toed Jerboa, Dipus sagitta*** Eremodipus**** Lichtenstein's Jerboa, Eremodipus lichensteini*** Jaculus**** Blanford's Jerboa, Jaculus blanfordi**** Lesser Egyptian Jerboa, Jaculus jaculus**** Greater Egyptian Jerboa, Jaculus orientalis**** Turkmen Jerboa, Jaculus turcmenicus*** Stylodipus**** Andrews's Three-toed Jerboa, Stylodipus andrewsi**** Mongolian Three-toed Jerboa, Stylodipus sungorus**** Thick-tailed Three-toed Jerboa, Stylodipus telum** Subfamily Euchoreutinae*** Euchoreutes**** Long-eared Jerboa, Euchoreutes naso** Subfamily Allactaginae*** Allactaga**** Balikun Jerboa, Allactaga balikunica**** Gobi Jerboa, Allactaga bullata**** Small Five-toed Jerboa, Allactaga elater**** Euphrates Jerboa, Allactaga euphratica**** Iranian Jerboa, Allactaga firouzi**** Hotson's Jerboa, Allactaga hotsoni**** Great Jerboa, Allactaga major**** Severtzov's Jerboa, Allactaga severtzovi**** Mongolian Five-toed Jerboa, Allactaga sibirica**** Four-toed Jerboa, Allactaga tetradactyla**** Vinogradov's Jerboa, Allactaga vinogradovi**** Bobrinski's Jerboa, Allactodipus bobrinskii*** Pygeretmus**** Lesser Fat-tailed Jerboa, Pygeretmus platyurus**** Dwarf Fat-tailed Jerboa, Pygeretmus pumilo**** Greater Fat-tailed Jerboa, Pygeretmus shitkovi** Subfamily Paradipodinae*** Paradipus**** Comb-toed Jerboa, Paradipus ctenodactylus\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{sisterlinks|Jerboa}}*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7130484.stm Long Eared Jerboa caught on film] BBC - retrieved 10th Dec 2007\n\n{{Dipodidae nav}}\n\nCategory:DipodidaeCategory:Arabic words and phrasesCategory:Fauna of EgyptCategory:Fauna of Central AsiaCategory:Mammals of Southwest AsiaCategory:Mammals of Africa\n\nar:Ø¬Ø±Ø¨ÙØ¹br:Jerboazde:SpringmÃ¤usees:Jerbofr:Gerboisehe:××¨×××¢ka:ááá¬áá¡ áá£á áá¦ááá¡ááá áált:Å okliniaili:Zjerboahu:UgrÃ³egÃ©rfÃ©lÃ©knl:Jerboa'sja:ããããºãpl:Skoczkowatept:Jerboaru:Ð¢ÑÑÐºÐ°Ð½ÑÐ¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²ÑÐµsv:SpringrÃ¥ttorzh:è·³é¼ ç§","category":"Mammals_of_Africa"},{"page_id":78882,"parsed_text":"{{pp-semi|small=yes}} {{Redirect|Panina|the Russian surname Panina|Panin}}{{Taxobox| name = Chimpanzees| image = Schimpanse zoo-leipig.jpg| image_caption = Common Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Chordata| classis = Mammalia| ordo = Primates| familia = Hominidae| subfamilia = Homininae| tribus = Hominini| subtribus = Panina| genus = Pan| genus_authority = Oken, 1816| type_species = Pan troglodytes| range_map = Pan.png| range_map_caption = Distribution of Pan spp.| subdivision_ranks = Species| subdivision = Pan troglodytes<br/>Pan paniscus}}\n\nChimpanzee, sometimes colloquially chimp, is the common name for the two extant species of ape in the genus Pan. The Congo River forms the boundary between the native habitat of the two species:*Common Chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes (West and Central Africa)*Bonobo, Pan paniscus (forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo)\n\nChimpanzees are members of the Hominidae family, along with gorillas, humans, and orangutans. Chimpanzees split from human evolution about 6 million years ago and the two chimpanzee species are the closest living relatives to humans, all being members of the Hominini tribe (along with extinct species of Hominina subtribe). Chimpanzees are the only known members of the Panina subtribe. The two Pan species split only about one million years ago.\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n===Evolutionary relationship===\n{{further|History of hominoid taxonomy}}thumbThe genus Pan is now considered to be part of the subfamily Homininae to which humans also belong. These two species are the closest living evolutionary relatives to humans, sharing a common ancestor with humans six million years ago. Research by Mary-Claire King in 1973 found 99% identical DNA between human beings and chimpanzees, although research since has modified that finding to about 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in non-coding DNA. It has been proposed that troglodytes and paniscus belong with sapiens in the genus Homo, rather than in Pan. One of the arguments for this is that other species have been reclassified to belong to the same genus on the basis of less genetic similarity than that between humans and chimpanzees.\n\n===Fossils===\nMany human fossils have been found, but chimpanzee fossils were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa. However, chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This would indicate that both humans and members of the Pan clade were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene.\n\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nThe male common chimp is up to 1.7 m (up to 5.6&nbsp;ft) high when standing, and weighs as much as 70&nbsp;kg (154&nbsp;lb); the female is somewhat smaller. The common chimpâs long arms, when extended, have a span half again as long as the bodyâs height and are longer than its legs. The bonobo is a little shorter and thinner than the common chimpanzee but has longer limbs. Both species use their long, powerful arms for climbing in trees. On the ground, chimpanzees usually walk on all fours using their knuckles for support with their hands clenched, a form of locomotion called knuckle-walking. Chimpanzee feet are better suited for walking than are those of the orangutan because the chimpâs soles are broader and the toes shorter. Both the common chimpanzee and bonobo can walk upright on two legs when carrying objects with their hands and arms. The coat is dark; the face, fingers, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet are hairless; and the chimp has no tail. A bony shelf over the eyes gives the forehead a receding appearance, and the nose is flat. Although the jaws protrude, the lips are thrust out only when a chimp pouts. The brain of a chimpanzee is about half the size of the human brain.\n\nChimpanzee testicles are unusually large for their body size, with a combined weight of about {{convert|4|oz}} compared to a gorilla's {{convert|1|oz}} or a human's {{convert|1.5|oz}}. This is generally attributed to sperm competition due to the polyandrous nature of chimpanzee mating behavior.\n\nThe exposed skin of the face, hands and feet varies from pink to very dark in both species, but is generally lighter in younger individuals, darkening as maturity is reached. The Bonobo has proportionately longer upper limbs and tends to walk upright more often than the Common Chimpanzee. A University of Chicago Medical Centre study has found significant genetic differences between chimpanzee populations. \n\nChimpanzees reach puberty at an age of between 8 and 10 years and rarely live past the age of 40 in the wild, but have been known to reach the age of more than 60 in captivity.\n\n==Behaviors==\nleftAnatomical differences between the Common Chimpanzee and the Bonobo are slight, but in sexual and social behaviour there are marked differences. The Common Chimpanzee has an omnivorous diet, a troop hunting culture based on beta males led by an alpha male, and highly complex social relationships. \n\nThe Bonobo, on the other hand, has a mostly frugivorous diet and an egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. Bonobos are well known to have frequent sex, with bisexuality the norm for both males and females, and also to use sex to help prevent and resolve conflicts. Different groups of chimpanzees also have different cultural behaviour with preferences for types of tools.\n\nThe Common Chimpanzee tends to display higher levels of aggression than the Bonobo.\n\n===Intelligence===\n{{further|Primate cognition}}thumbChimpanzees make tools and use them to acquire foods and for social displays; they have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring cooperation, influence and rank; they are status conscious, manipulative and capable of deception; they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax, concepts of number and numerical sequence; and they are capable of spontaneous planning for a future state or event.\n\n====Tool use====\nOne of the most significant discoveries was in October 1960 when Jane Goodall observed the use of tools among chimpanzees. Recent research indicates that chimpanzee stone tool use dates to at least 4,300 years ago. Chimpanzee tool usage includes digging into termite mounds with a large stick tool, and then using a small stick that has been altered to \"fish\" the termites out. A recent study revealed the use of such advanced tools as spears, which Common Chimpanzees in Senegal sharpen with their teeth and use to spear Senegal Bushbabies out of small holes in trees. Before the discovery of tool use in chimps, it was believed that humans were the only species to make and use tools, but several other tool-using species are now known.\n\n====Empathy====\n Recent studies have shown that chimpanzees engage in apparently altruistic behaviour within groups, but are indifferent to the welfare of unrelated group members.\n\nEvidence for \"chimpanzee spirituality\" includes display of mourning, \"incipient romantic love\", \"rain dance\", appreciation of natural beauty such as a sunset over a lake, curiosity and respect towards wildlife (such as the python, which is neither a threat nor a food source to chimpanzees), empathy toward other species (such as feeding turtles) and even \"animism\" or \"pretend play\" in chimps cradling and grooming rocks or sticks.\n\n====Communication====\nChimps communicate in a manner similar to human non-verbal communication, using vocalizations, hand gestures, and facial expressions. Research into the chimpanzee brain has revealed that chimp communication activates an area of the chimp brain that is in the same position as Broca's area, the language center in the human brain.\n\n==== Studies of language ====\n{{main|Great ape language}}thumbScientists have long been fascinated with the studies of language, believing it to be a unique human cognitive ability. To test this hypothesis, scientists have attempted to teach human language to several species of great apes. One early attempt by Allen and Beatrice Gardner in the 1960s involved spending 51 months teaching American Sign Language to a chimpanzee named Washoe. The Gardners reported that Washoe learned 151 signs, and that she had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzees. Over a longer period of time, Washoe learned over 800 signs. \n\nThere is ongoing debate among some scientists, notably Noam Chomsky and David Premack, about non-human great apes' ability to learn language. Since the early reports on Washoe, numerous other studies have been conducted with varying levels of success, including one involving a chimpanzee named, in parody, Nim Chimpsky, trained by Herbert Terrace of Columbia University. Although his initial reports were quite positive, in November 1979, Terrace and his team re-evaluated the videotapes of Nim with his trainers, analyzing them frame by frame for signs as well as for exact context (what was happening both before and after Nimâs signs). In the re-analysis, Terrace concluded that Nimâs utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. âMuch of the apesâ behavior is pure drill,â he said. âLanguage still stands as an important definition of the human species.â In this reversal, Terrace now argued that Nimâs use of ASL was not like human language acquisition. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did. Nimâs sentences also did not grow in length, unlike human children whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation.\n\n====Memory====\nA 30-year study at Kyoto Universityâs Primate Research Institute has shown that chimps are able to learn to recognize the numbers 1-9 and their values. The chimps further show an aptitude for photographic memory, demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits 1-9 are flashed onto a computer screen for less than a quarter of a second, after which the chimp, Ayumu, is able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. The same experiment was failed by world memory champion Ben Pridmore on most attempts.\n\n====Laughter in apes====\nthumbLaughter might not be confined or unique to humans. The differences between chimpanzee and human laughter may be the result of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech. Self-awareness of one's situation as seen in the mirror test, or the ability to identify with another's predicament (see mirror neurons), are prerequisites for laughter, so animals may be laughing in the same way that humans do.\n\nChimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans show laughterlike vocalizations in response to physical contact, such as wrestling, play chasing, or tickling. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common Chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognizable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. There are instances in which non-human primates have been reported to have expressed joy. One study analysed and recorded sounds made by human babies and Bonobos when tickled. It found that although the Bonobo's laugh was a higher frequency, the laugh followed a pattern similar to that of human babies and included similar facial expressions. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.:See also: Laughter in animals\n\n===Aggression===\nthumb\n\nAdult Common Chimpanzees, particularly males, can be very aggressive. They are highly territorial and are known to kill other chimps. Chimpanzees also engage in targeted hunting of lower order primates such as the red colobus and bush babies, and use the meat from these kills as a \"social tool\" within their community. In February 2009, after an incident in which a pet chimp named Travis attacked a woman in Stamford, Connecticut, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a primate pet ban in the United States.\n\n==Interactions with humans==\n===History===\nthumbAfricans have had contact with chimpanzees for millennia. Chimpanzees have been kept as pets for centuries in a few African villages, especially in Democratic Republic of Congo. In Virunga National Park in the east of the country the park authorities regularly confiscate chimpanzees from people who are keeping them as pets. The first recorded contact of Europeans with chimps took place in present-day Angola during the 1600s. The diary of Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1506), preserved in the Portuguese National Archive (Torre do Tombo), is probably the first European document to acknowledge that chimpanzees built their own rudimentary tools.\n\nThe first use of the name \"chimpanzee\", however, did not occur until 1738. The name is derived from a Tshiluba language term \"kivili-chimpenze\", which is the local name for the animal and translates loosely as \"mockman\" or possibly just \"ape\". The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s. Biologists applied Pan as the genus name of the animal. Chimps as well as other apes had also been purported to have been known to Western writers in ancient times, but mainly as myths and legends on the edge of European and Arab societal consciousness, mainly through fragmented and sketchy accounts of European adventurers. Apes are mentioned variously by Aristotle, as well as the Bible, where apes and baboons are described as having been collected by Solomon in 1 Kings 10:22. \n\nThe first of these early transcontinental chimpanzees came from Angola and were presented as a gift to Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange in 1640, and were followed by a few of its brethren over the next several years. Scientists described these first chimpanzees as \"pygmies\", and noted the animals' distinct similarities to humans. The next two decades would see a number of the creatures imported into Europe, mainly acquired by various zoological gardens as entertainment for visitors. \n\nthumb\n\nDarwin's theory of natural selection (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, as in much of life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees at the time were mainly interested in behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific than it might sound, with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered 'good'; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated, as immortalized in Hugo Rheinhold's Affe mit SchÃ¤del (see image, left). By the end of the 1800s chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.\n\nthumbThe 20th century saw a new age of scientific research into chimpanzee behaviour. Before 1960, almost nothing was known about chimpanzee behaviour in their natural habitat. In July of that year, Jane Goodall set out to Tanzania's Gombe forest to live among the chimpanzees, where she primarily studied the members of the Kasakela chimpanzee community. Her discovery that chimpanzees made and used tools was groundbreaking, as humans were previously believed to be the only species to do so. The most progressive early studies on chimpanzees were spearheaded primarily by Wolfgang KÃ¶hler and Robert Yerkes, both of whom were renowned psychologists. Both men and their colleagues established laboratory studies of chimpanzees focused specifically on learning about the intellectual abilities of chimpanzees, particularly problem-solving. This typically involved basic, practical tests on laboratory chimpanzees, which required a fairly high intellectual capacity (such as how to solve the problem of acquiring an out-of-reach banana). Notably, Yerkes also made extensive observations of chimpanzees in the wild which added tremendously to the scientific understanding of chimpanzees and their behaviour. Yerkes studied chimpanzees until World War II, while KÃ¶hler concluded five years of study and published his famous Mentality of Apes in 1925 (which is coincidentally when Yerkes began his analyses), eventually concluding that \"chimpanzees manifest intelligent behaviour of the general kind familiar in human beings ... a type of behaviour which counts as specifically human\" (1925).\n\nThe August, 2008, issue of the American Journal of Primatology reports results of a year-long study of chimpanzees in Tanzaniaâs Mahale Mountains National Park which produced evidence that chimpanzees are becoming sick from viral infectious diseases they have likely contracted from humans. Molecular, microscopic and epidemiological investigations demonstrated that the chimpanzees living at Mahale Mountains National Park have been suffering from a respiratory disease that is likely caused by a variant of a human paramyxovirus.\n\n===Studies===\n{{POV-section|date=December 2008}}leftAs of November 2007, there were 1,300 chimpanzees housed in 10 U.S. laboratories (out of 3,000 great apes living in captivity there), either wild-caught, or acquired from circuses, animal trainers, or zoos. Most of the labs either conduct or make the chimps available for invasive research, defined as \"inoculation with an infectious agent, surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee, and/or drug testing\". Two federally funded laboratories use chimps: Yerkes National Primate Research Laboratory at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Southwest National Primate Center in San Antonio, Texas. Five hundred chimps have been retired from laboratory use in the U.S. and live in sanctuaries in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nChimpanzees used in biomedical research tend to be used repeatedly over decades, rather than used and killed as with most laboratory animals. Some individual chimps currently in U.S. laboratories have been used in experiments for over 40 years. According to Project R&R, a campaign to release chimps held in U.S. labsârun by the New England Anti-Vivisection Society in conjunction with Jane Goodall and other primate researchersâthe oldest known chimp in a U.S. lab is Wenka, who was born in a laboratory in Florida on May 21, 1954. She was removed from her mother on the day of birth to be used in a vision experiment that lasted 17 months, then sold as a pet to a family in North Carolina. She was returned to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in 1957 when she became too big to handle. Since then, she has given birth six times, and has been used in research into alcohol use, oral contraceptives, ageing, and cognitive studies.\n\nWith the publication of the chimpanzee genome, there are reportedly plans to increase the use of chimps in labs, with some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimps for research should be lifted. A five-year moratorium was imposed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1996, because too many chimps had been bred for HIV research, and it has been extended annually since 2001. \n\nOther researchers argue that chimps are unique animals and either should not be used in research, or should be treated differently. Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the University of California, San Diego, argues that, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using chimps should follow the ethical guidelines that are used for human subjects unable to give consent. Also, a recent study suggests that chimpanzees which are retired from labs exhibit a form of posttraumatic stress disorder. Stuart Zola, director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Laboratory, disagrees. He told National Geographic: \"I don't think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species, whether it's a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee. No matter how much we may wish it, chimps are not human.\" \n\nAn increasing number of governments are enacting a Great Ape research ban forbidding the use of chimpanzees and other great apes in research or toxicology testing. As of 2006, Austria, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK had introduced such bans.\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{see also|List of fictional apes|Category:Famous apes}}Chimpanzees have been commonly stereotyped in popular culture, where they are most often cast in standardized roles as childlike companions, sidekicks or clowns. They are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial features, long limbs and fast movements, which humans often find amusing. Accordingly, entertainment acts featuring chimpanzees dressed up as humans have been traditional staples of circuses and stage shows.\n\nIn the age of television, a new genre of chimp act emerged in the United States: series whose cast consisted entirely of chimpanzees dressed as humans and \"speaking\" lines dubbed by human actors. These shows, examples of which include Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp in the 1970s or The Chimp Channel in the 1990s, relied on the novelty of their ape cast to make their timeworn, low comedy gags funny. Their chimpanzee \"actors\" were as interchangeable as the apes in a circus act, being amusing as chimpanzees and not as individuals. \n\nWhen chimpanzees appear in other TV shows, they generally do so as comic relief sidekicks to humans. In that role, for instance, J. Fred Muggs appeared with Today Show host Dave Garroway in the 1950s, \"Judy\" on Daktari in the 1960s or \"Darwin\" on The Wild Thornberrys in the 1990s. Chimpanzee characters and actions are almost never relevant to the plot, in contrast to the fictional depictions of other animals, such as dogs (as in Lassie), dolphins (Flipper), horses (The Black Stallion) or even other great apes (King Kong).\n\nThe rare exceptionsâdepictions of chimpanzees as individuals rather than stock characters, and as central rather than incidental to the plotâare usually found in science fiction. Robert A. Heinlein's short story \"Jerry Was a Man\" (1947) centers on a genetically enhanced chimpanzee suing for better treatment, a theme also echoed in David Brin's 1990s Uplift series. In film, the 1972 movie Conquest of the Planet of the Apes centers on a fierce revolt of enslaved apes, led by the chimpanzee Caesar, against their human masters. In one episode of the television series Monk, a chimp was in danger of being euthanized after it was thought to have killed its owner.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Mammals|Okapi2.jpg}}* Chimpanzee genome project* Great ape personhood* List of apes\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n;General references{{Refbegin}}* Pickrell, John.

Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears. The name \"Fennec\" comes from the Arabic for fox, and the species name zerda has a Greek origin referring to its habitat. The Fennec is the smallest species of canid in the world; its coat, ears and kidney functions have adapted to a high-temperature, low-water, desert environment. In addition, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground.\n\nThe Fennec can live up to 12 years in the wild, and its main predators include the Caracal and the African varieties of Eagle Owl. Fennec families dig out dens in sand for habitation and protection, which can be up to {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin other families' dens. Precise population figures are not known, but are estimated from the frequency of sightings, and indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge on social interaction is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus Vulpes; however, this is debated due to differences between the Fennec Fox and other fox species. The Fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an exotic pet.\n\n==Description==\n{{listen|filename=Fennec Singing.ogg|pos=left|title=Fennec singing|description=|format=ogg}}The Fennec Fox weighs about {{convert|1.5|-|3.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|40|cm|0|abbr=on}}, is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall, and is the smallest species of canid in the world. The tail has a black tip and is the length of around three quarters of the head and body length, whilst the ears can be between {{convert|10|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. Its name comes from the Arabic word fenek, which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, in reference to the fox's habitat.\n\nThe coat is often a cream color and fluffy, which deflects heat during the day and keeps the fox warm at night. The Fennec's characteristic ears are the largest among foxes relative to body size, and serve to dissipate heat, as they have many blood vessels close to the skin. The ears of a Fennec are sensitive enough to hear prey that may be underground, and the soles of its feet are protected from the hot desert sand by thick fur.\n\n===Social behaviour===\nthumbInformation on Fennec Fox social behaviour is mainly based on captive animals. The basic social unit is thought to be a mated pair and their offspring, and the young of the previous year are thought to remain in the family even when a new litter is born. Playing behaviour is common, including among adults of the species.\n\nCaptive animals engage in highly affiliative behaviour, typically resting in contact with each other. Males tend to show more aggression and urine-marking around the time of the females' estrous cycle. They have been seen to bury feces by pushing soil with their noses or hind feet when in captivity. Much remains unknown of their basic ecology and behavior in the wild and a 2004 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature stated that \"in-depth study of the species, with particular emphasis on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild, is overdue.\"\n\n===Diet and hunting===\nThe Fennec Fox is a nocturnal omnivore. Food sources include rodents, insects, birds and eggs. An individual can jump up to {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on}} forward, which helps it catch prey and escape predators. When hunting, large eared foxes such as the Fennec, or the Bat-eared Fox, can seem to stare at the ground while they rotate their heads from side to side in order to pinpoint the location of prey, either underground or hidden above ground.\n\nThe species is adapted to live without free water, and its kidneys are adapted to restrict water loss. A Fennec's burrowing can cause the formation of dew. They are also known to absorb water through food consumption; but will drink water if available.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nthumbFennec Foxes are social animals that mate for life, with each pair or family controlling their own territory. Sexual maturity is reached at around nine months old. In the wild, mating usually occurs between January and February for litters to be born between March and April. However, in captivity most litters are born later, between March and July, although births can occur year round. The species usually breeds only once each year. The copulation tie has been recorded as lasting up to two hours and 45 minutes. Following mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protective of the female, providing her with food during her pregnancy and lactation periods.\n\nGestation is usually between 50 to 52 days, although there have been 62 and 63 day gestation periods reported from foxes in captivity. The typical litter is between one and four kits, with weaning taking place at around 61 to 70 days. When born, the kit's ears are folded over and its eyes are closed, with the eyes opening at around ten days and the ears lifting soon afterwards. The life span of a Fennec Fox has been recorded as up to 12 years in captivity but only up to ten in the wild.\n\n== Habitat ==\nthumbthumbThe species is found in North Africa and Asia. The range is from Morocco through to Egypt, as far south as northern Niger and as far east as the Sinai Peninsula and Kuwait.\n\nA Fennec Fox's typical den is dug in sand, either in open areas or places sheltered by plants. In compacted soils, dens can be up to 120 square meters, with up to 15 different entrances. In some cases different families interconnect their dens, or locate them close together. In soft, looser sand, dens tend to be simpler with only one entrance leading to a single chamber.\n\n=== Population ===\nThe Fennec Fox is classified as \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List,, and as a CITES Appendix II species: species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but whose trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival. It is often hunted by humans, though it does not cause any direct harm to human interests, such as livestock. Like other foxes, it is prized for its fur by the indigenous people of the Sahara and Sinai.\n\nCurrent statistics on population are not known, but the population is assumed to be adequate based on observations of traders commonly trapping Fennec Foxes in Northern Africa for exhibition or sale to tourists. In southern Morocco, the Fennec Fox is commonly seen in sandy areas away from permanent human settlements.\n\n===Predators===\nThe Fennec Fox's main predators are Caracals and the various African varieties of Eagle Owl. Other possible predators include Jackals, Striped Hyenas and the Saluki, a greyhound-like domestic dog local to the area. However Fennec Foxes are considered very difficult to capture, and reports of predators other than the Eagle Owl are considered to be anecdotal and questionable.\n\nThey are commonly trapped for sale to the pet trade and for fur by the human population of Northern Africa. In southern Morocco in particular, the meat of the Fennec Fox is not eaten because it is considered to be foul smelling.\n\n== Classification ==\nThe species was previously classified in the genus Fennecus, but have since been reclassified to the genus Vulpes which includes a variety of other types of foxes. Scientists have debated that whilst similar, a Fennec Fox has a variety of differences that set it apart from other species of fox, including both physical and sociological traits. This has led to two conflicting classifications: Vulpes zerda, implying that the Fennec Fox is a true fox, and Fennecus zerda, implying that the Fennec Fox belongs to its own genus.\n\nPhysically, the Fennec lacks the musk glands of other Fox species, and has only 32 chromosome pairs, while other fox species have between 35 and 39. The species also displays uncharacteristic behaviours, such as living in packs while most other fox species are solitary.\n\n== As pets ==\nthumbThe Fennec Fox is bred commercially as an alternative house pet. Breeders tend to remove the young kits from the mother to hand-rear, as tamer and more handleable foxes make better pets and are therefore considered more valuable.\n\nThe species is classified a \"Small wild/exotic canid\" by the United States Department of Agriculture, along with the Coyote, Dingo, Jackal, Arctic Fox and Silver Fox, and is considered the only species of fox which can properly be kept as a pet. Although it cannot be considered domesticated, it can be kept in a domestic setting similar to dogs or cats. A breeders' registry has been set up in the USA to avoid any problems associated with inbreeding. The legality of owning a Fennec Fox varies by jurisdiction, as with many exotic pets.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies|Vulpes zerda}}{{commons|Vulpes zerda}}* [http://exoticpets.about.com/od/fennecfoxes/ About.com Exotic Pets] - Entry on Fennec Fox\n\n{{Carnivora|Ca.}}\n\nCategory:FoxesFox, FennecFox, FennecFox, FennecCategory:Pet mammals\n\nar:ÙÙÙbn:à¦«à§à¦¨à§à¦ à¦¶à§à¦¯à¦¼à¦¾à¦²bar:WÃ¼stnfuxbr:Fennegbg:Ð¤ÐµÐ½ÐµÐºca:Fenneccs:Fenekda:Fennekde:Fenneknv:MÄÊ¼ii bijaaÊ¼tsohÃ­et:Fennekrebanees:Fennecus zerdaeo:Fenekoeu:Feneko azerifa:Ø±ÙØ¨Ø§Ù ØµØ­Ø±Ø§ÛÛfr:Fennecko:íë¥ì¬ì°hr:Pustinjska lisicais:EyÃ°imerkurrefurit:Vulpes zerdahe:×¤× ×§ka:á¤ááááála:Vulpes zerdalv:Fenekslb:WÃ¼stefuusslt:Fenekashu:Sivatagi rÃ³kanl:Fennek (vos)ja:ãã§ããã¯no:Fenneknn:Fennekpl:Fenekpt:Fenecoru:Ð¤ÐµÐ½ÐµÐºsimple:Fennec Foxsl:Fenekfi:Aavikkokettusv:Fennektr:ÃÃ¶l tilkisiur:ØµØ­Ø±Ø§Ø¦Û ÙÙÙÚzh:è³å»ç","category":"Mammals_of_Africa"},{"page_id":681,"parsed_text":"{{Otheruses}}{{Taxobox| name = Aardwolf| fossil_range = Pleistocene - Recent| status = LC| status_system = IUCN3.1| status_ref = | image = Proteles cristatus1.jpg| image_width = 300px| image_caption = Aardwolf| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Chordata| classis = Mammalia| ordo = Carnivora| familia = Hyaenidae| subfamilia = Protelinae| subfamilia_authority = Flower, 1869| genus = Proteles| genus_authority = I.

The name means \"earth wolf\" in Afrikaans/Dutch. It is also called \"maanhaar-jackal\" and \"protelid\". Unlike other hyenas, the diet of the aardwolf almost completely consists of termites, other insect larvae and carrion.\n\nThe aardwolf is the only surviving species of the subfamily Protelinae. Two subspecies are recognized: Proteles cristatus cristatus of Southern Africa, and Proteles cristatus septentrionalis of eastern and northeastern Africa. It is usually placed in the Hyaenidae, though formerly separated into a monotypic family, Protelidae. The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa. These are the areas of land covered with stunted trees or shrubs. The aardwolf hides in a burrow during the day and comes out at night to search for food. It is related to hyenas, but unlike its relatives, it does not hunt large prey. This unusual animal is a mass killer-of insects. It feeds mainly on termites and can eat more than 200,000 in a single night, using its long, sticky tongue to collect them.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nThe aardwolf looks most like the Striped Hyena, but is significantly smaller with a more slender muzzle, sharper ears utilized in the hunt for harvester termites, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct mane down the middle line of the neck and back, which is raised during a confrontation to make the aardwolf's size appear bigger. It is 55&ndash;80&nbsp;cm long, excluding its bushy 20&ndash;30&nbsp;cm tail, stands about 40&ndash;50&nbsp;cm at the shoulder, and weighs between 9 and 14&nbsp;kg. Its front feet have 5 toes, unlike other hyenas which have four toes. Its teeth and skull are similar to that of the hyena, although the cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects, and its tongue for licking them up. As the aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on their feeding habits due to the soft nature of the insects they consume. It has two glands at the rear that secrete a musky fluid for marking territory and communicating with other aardwolves.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe aardwolf lives on open, dry plains and bushland, while avoiding mountainous areas. Due to its specific food requirements, the animal is only found in regions where termites of the family Hodotermitidae occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs, including farmland. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at a time.\n\nThere are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests.\n\n==Behavior==\nthumbAardwolves are shy and nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows by day. They usually use existing burrows of aardvarks, Old World porcupines or springhares, despite being capable of creating their own. By night, an aardwolf can consume up to 200,000 harvester termites using its sticky, long tongue. They take special care not to destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, which ensures that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorise and return to nests to save the trouble of finding a new one. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, and eggs, and occasionally small mammals and birds. Unlike other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.\n\nThe adult aardwolf is primarily solitary while foraging for food, necessary because of the scarcity and homogeneous distribution of their insect prey. They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as monogamous pairs, with their young, defending the same territory. Young aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity after two years, and the breeding season varies depending on their location, but normally takes place during the autumn or spring. During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves will search their own territory as well as others' for a female to mate with. Dominant males will also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves. This can often result in conflict between two male aardwolves when one has wandered into another's territory. Gestation lasts between 90 and 110 days, producing one to five cubs (most often two or three) during the rainy season, when termites are active. The first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with the mother. After three months, they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent. However, they will often use the same den as their mother until the next breeding season. They can achieve a lifespan of up to 15 years when in captivity.\n\n==Interaction with humans==\nAgriculture may create a negative impact on their population due to use of poisons by farmers. They are often considered useful, non-dangerous animals by farmers. However, in some areas the aardwolf is hunted for its fur. Encounters with dogs are another threat.\n\n<gallery>Image:Aardwolf (Harvard University).JPG|Proteles cristatusImage:Aardwolf.png|Illustration of Proteles cristatus</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Aard-wolf}}{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Proteles cristatus}}{{Wikispecies|Proteles cristatus}}* [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Proteles_cristatus.html Animal Diversity Web]* [http://www.hyaenidae.org/the-hyaenidae/aardwolf-proteles-cristatus.html IUCN Hyaenidae Specialist Group Aardwolf pages on hyaenidae.org]\n\n{{Carnivora|F.}}\n\nCategory:HyenasCategory:Mammals of AfricaCategory:Mammals of KenyaCategory:Myrmecophagous mammalsCategory:Words of Afrikaans origin{{Link FA|de}}\n\naf:Aardwolfckb:Ú©ÛÙØªÛØ§Ø±Û ÙÛØ±ÙÙØ®ÙÛØ±ar:Ø°Ø¦Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ£Ø±Ø¶br:Protelbg:ÐÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½ Ð²ÑÐ»Ðºcs:Hyenka hÅivnatÃ¡da:Jordulvde:Erdwolfnv:ChÊ¼osh yighÃ¡nÃ­es:Proteles cristatuseo:Protelofr:ProtÃ¨leko:ëëëit:Proteles cristatushe:×¦×××¢××ka:ááá¬áá¡ ááááált:UrvinÄ hienahu:CibethiÃ©nanl:Aardwolfja:ã¢ã¼ãã¦ã«ãno:Jordulvpl:Protelpt:Lobo-da-terraru:ÐÐµÐ¼Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð²Ð¾Ð»Ðºscn:Protelessi:à¶'à¶à¶©à·à·à·à¶½à·à·à·fi:Maasusisv:Jordvargur:Ú©Ø±Ù Ø®ÙØ± ÙÚ¯ÚØ¨Ú¾Ú¯Ø§zh:åç¼","category":"Mammals_of_Africa"}]
